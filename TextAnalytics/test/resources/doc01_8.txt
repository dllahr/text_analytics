Jan. 10--PEORIA -- Before one can understand the extent of Caterpillar Inc.'s
operations in China, one has to appreciate the size of China itself.

China is a country with 1.3 billion people, with five cities having populations
larger than New York City. And it's growing.

Caterpillar expects China's construction equipment market to grow by 10 percent
in 2012. Rich Lavin, group president at Caterpillar with responsibility for the
Asian market, said the Chinese market is expected to grow at a "fairly
significant" rate for the foreseeable future.

Lavin made the comments ahead of the Asian Financial Forum 2012 set for Hong
Kong Jan. 16 and 17.

Last week, Caterpillar announced the expansion of the company's research and
development in Wuxi. The center, which opened two years ago, has more than 500
engineers and support staff.

"I made my first overseas trip to China in 1988, when we served that market
with imported product," recalled Lavin in an interview last year. "Now we
employ 8,500 people with 15 facilities and a number of additional offices. Our
dealers employ a similar number of people," he said.

"It's been a generational change for China in the past 23 years, especially in
the past 10," said Lavin.

Norm Durflinger, the mayor of Morton, saw evidence of the growth last year as
part of an Illinois trade mission that visited China.

"I was blown away with all the cranes in operation and the number of high-rises
and apartment complexes being built," he said.

"We also visited Morton's sister city of Tiantai while we were there. The mayor
(in Tiantai) said that China was in the process of bringing people from the
countryside into the city," said Durflinger.

Along with China's urban growth, there's talk of creating a super-city that
would combine nine cities in southern China (near Hong Kong) to create an urban
mass with a population of more than 40 million people.

The plan, announced in state media, would link Guangzhou (12 million), Shenzhen
(8.6 million), Dongguan (6.l9 million) and six smaller cities.

"In terms of geography, the new mega-city will be roughly twice as big as New
Jersey," noted Popular Science in an article published last year. "More than
150 infrastructure projects costing some $300 billion will link the nine cities
together over the next six years, bringing nearly 10 percent of China's economy
under a single umbrella," the article noted.
