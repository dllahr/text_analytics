Sept. 04--JAKARTA (THE JAKARTA POST/ANN) -- Former Indonesian finance minister and current World Bank managing director Sri Mulyani Indrawati has been listed for the third year in Forbes list of the world's 100 most powerful women.
In the 2011 list released recently, Forbes put Mulyani in the 63rd place, up from 71 in 2009, but still far from her rank of 23 she had in 2008.
Forbes said Mulyani's achievements included managing to cut Indonesia's debts by half and increasing the country's foreign exchange reserves to more than US$50 billion.
Mulyani also managed to reform her office while serving at the finance ministry, making it one of the least corrupt institutions in graft-ridden Indonesia, and creating a business climate conducive for businesses, Forbes added, as quoted by tempointeraktif.com.
Mulyani is the only Indonesian woman in the 2011 list, which puts German Chancellor Angela Markel in the top place, followed by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseffm, PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg.
Co-founder and co-chair of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Melinda Gates, is in sixth place, followed by Indian National Congress Party chairwoman Sonia Gandhi, US First Lady Michele Obama, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde and Kraft Foods CEO Irene Rosenfeld. Lady Gaga is the most powerful female celebrity, securing 11th place.

CHICAGO, Aug. 31, 2011 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The first annual review of the state of diversity in the legal profession from the Institute for Inclusion in the Legal Profession clearly points to a serious problem in the pipeline, despite numerous programs, studies and individual efforts to effect change in the representation of diverse groups in the profession. The review shows that the legal profession continues to lag behind others with slow progress and that minority lawyers take different career paths.
Highlights of the study include:
Minority representation in the profession has grown from 9.7% in 2000 to 11.6% in 2009.
Women now compose 32.4 percent of the profession, but are underrepresented into top level jobs such as partner (19.4 percent), federal appellate judge (26.8 percent) and law school dean (20.6 percent).
African Americans are the best represented minority group at 4.7 percent, but their entry into the profession has slowed in recent years.
Minority and women's representation among law graduates has dropped slightly in recent years.
Employment patterns for white and minority law graduates have converged since the late 1990s, except for judicial clerkship rates, where the divergence has increased.
Women's initial employment continues to differ from men's among both white and minority law graduates; women are less likely than men to enter private practice and business.
African Americans and Native Americans continue to be significantly less likely than other groups to enter private practice; Asian Americans are more likely than other groups, including whites.
Lawyers with disabilities are less likely than other groups to enter private practice, and significantly more likely to enter public interest jobs.
Women are more likely than men to go into public interest jobs.
The percentage of LGBT lawyers is small, but increasing.
These new demographics in the review were compiled and analyzed by Prof. Elizabeth Chambliss, co-director, Center for Professional Values and Practice, at New York Law School. As editor-in-chief of the review, she has brought together a number of outstanding lawyers and commentators to provide detailed analysis, digging deep into the facts to examine the data in an effort to identify new approaches to seeking solutions and increasing diversity in the profession. These essays examine common elements in diversity and inclusion and focus on the important differences and unique challenges across groups. Essayists include Melinda S. Molina, Capital University Law School; Takeia R. Johnson, a practicing lawyer in Indianapolis with Frost Brown Todd LLP; Kathleen Dillon Narko, Northwestern University School of Law; Lawrence R. Baca, former deputy director, Office of Tribal Justice of the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division; Jacob Herring, Creative Cultural Changes LLC, Sarah Olson, Professional Development and Diversity Director, Wildman Harrold Allen & Dixon LLP; and others in private practice and academic settings. Chambliss' analysis points out that better data are needed to advance the analysis beyond general comparisons and she urges the legal profession to provide better general and ethnic breakdowns across the profession and across various subgroups.
"The IILP Review is a comprehensive and thoughtful document that will help us better understand the facts and provide a basis for candid discussion about individual experiences. Some of the data is encouraging - some troubling - but a shared understanding of the data and a continued focus on the facts and figures is essential to finding, and fixing, problems. The essays are a must read as we begin a national dialogue to chart a course for the future," said Marc S. Firestone, chair of IILP and executive vice president, corporate and legal affairs, and general counsel, Kraft Foods, Inc. "The review reinforces data we found earlier that showed we had a long way to go to realize success in fostering diversity in business. The symptoms are there, we need to find an effective cure."
Noting that a shared conversation about diversity and inclusion has been difficult to sustain, Chambliss urges more communication and coordination of pipeline and other efforts to make it easier for busy lawyers, judges, law professors, students, employers and diversity professionals to stay current on the latest thought trends, research programs and challenges facing the profession.
The IILP is hosting seminars in several cities around the country throughout the fall featuring discussion of the data and presentations by several of the authors with a focus on local solutions and programs that meet the needs of the community. Headlining the sessions will be a thought-provoking presentation by Stuart Buck, doctoral fellow, Department of Education Reform, University of Arkansas and the author of the book, Acting White: The Ironic Legacy of Desegregation. Sessions are scheduled for Sept. 7 in San Francisco; Sept. 9 in Seattle; Sept. 20 in New York City; Sept. 21 in Washington, D.C.; Oct. 4 in Houston; and Oct. 26 in Chicago.
About the Institute for Inclusion in the Legal Profession Through its programs, projects, research, and collaborations, the Institute for Inclusion in the Legal Profession is dedicated to improving diversity and promoting inclusion in the legal profession. IILP is a leader in supporting new approaches and inventing and testing methodologies that will lead to real change and eliminate bias in the legal field. Through comprehensive outreach and original programming, IILP works closely with legal, judicial, professional, educational and governmental institutions to help the profession advance diversity as a core value.

Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/9bac75/diet_foods_market) has announced the addition of the "Diet Foods Market Update Market Report 2011" report to their offering.
This Market Update report on diet foods and drinks is split into two sectors: low-fat and reduced-sugar variants of traditional foods make up the largest category, and a much smaller category of meal replacement products consists of low-carbohydrate products (principally produced by Atkins Advantage) and low-calorie slimming foods, with the lion's share of the market belonging to Unilever's Slim-Fast products. However, over the past 5 years meal-replacement products have accounted for an increasingly smaller share of the market and this trend is expected to continue over the next 5 years, with the diet foods industry becoming ever more dominated by the low-fat and reduced-sugar products sector.
The market for low-fat and reduced-sugar products increased very rapidly between 2006 and 2010, rising from 3.84bn in 2006 to 5.33bn in 2010. Commodity prices and the cost of raw materials have been increasing over the review period and are responsible for some of the increases. However, the massive increase in volume sales has been the real driver in the diet foods sector. This is a perpetuating cycle as the Government pushes to achieve greater consumer awareness of a healthy diet and tries to address the UK's current obesity epidemic, more consumers are turning towards diet foods as a way of adopting a healthier lifestyle.

Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/e29e5d/bahrain_food_and_d) has announced the addition of the "Bahrain Food and Drink Report Q4 2011" report to their offering.
The Bahrain Food and Drink Report provides industry professionals and strategists, corporate analysts, food and drink associations, government departments and regulatory bodies with independent forecasts and competitive intelligence on Bahrain's food and drink industry.
The recent political tensions in Bahrain will weigh on consumer confidence, especially as there is no resolution in sight. Lacking a lasting political resolution to the current crisis, the threat of large-scale unrest will remain present, and the country's political climate is expected to remain tense through the remainder of 2011.
This will have an impact on economic growth, and the report forecasts Bahrain's economy contracting 1.6% in 2011 as the ongoing political crisis results in weaker consumption and investment patterns, and harms the country's all-important tourism and financial services industries. For the most part, higher oil prices and an increase in government spending (which will be supported by the US$10bn in foreign aid pledged by other Gulf states in February) will be crucial to preventing a more pronounced decline in headline growth.
Beyond 2011, BMI has lowered the five-year growth forecasts and now see real GDP expanding by an average 4.1% through 2015, compared to previous forecast of 5.4%. The longer-term outlook is broadly positive beyond 2011, assuming oil prices do not collapse and political stability is eventually restored. That said, the onset of violent unrest at the start of 2011 has raised a host of questions surrounding Bahrain's long-term outlook, with concerns growing that the country's financial services and tourism sectors will suffer heavily.
Headline Industry Data:
-- 2010 per capita food consumption = +10.9%; forecast to 2015 = +47.6%
-- 2010 soft drink value sales = +22.9%; forecast to 2015 = +29.8%
-- 2010 mass grocery retail sales = +20%; forecast to 2015 = +74.8%
Companies Mentioned:
-- Awal Dairy Company
-- Bahrain Flour Mills Company
-- Carrefour MAF
-- Delmon Poultry Company
-- EMKE Group
-- Fu-Com International/Gant

Los conglomerados han caído en desgracia. De ahí que compañías como Hewlett-Packard (HP), Kraft Foods o ConocoPhillips hayan decidido romperse en pedazos en las últimas semanas. Es tentador pensar que solo los banqueros de Wall Street, que ayudaron a juntar estos descomunales grupos, sean los que más se benefician de esta tendencia. Pero un par de ejemplos -Marathon Oil y Motorola- sugiere que los inversores lo hacen también.
La magia parece necesitar tiempo, y resultados concretos, para funcionar. Las acciones de HP y de ConocoPhillips, por ejemplo, han tenido un desempeño inferior en el mercado desde que anunciaron su separación. Las acciones de Kraft subieron un poco en términos de ajuste de mercado, pero las acciones de Fortune Brands, que ha trabajado todo el año en la escisión, están todavía por debajo de donde empezaron.
Marathon Oil, es otra historia. Los accionistas que ahora tienen participaciones de Marathon Oil y Marathon Petroleum han visto incrementar un 10% el valor respecto al momento justo antes del anuncio de separación.
Los propietarios de Motorola, convertida en Motorola Mobility y Motorola Solutions en enero, ahora tienen acciones que valen más del 20%, en términos de mercado ajustado, antes de que la separación se pusiera en marcha en marzo de 2008. La ganancia no surgió hasta la ruptura completa. Gran parte de la cual, de hecho, se debe al acuerdo reciente con Google para comprar Motorola. Pero eso es a menudo el punto de partida de una separación -hace que las piezas individuales sean más apetecibles-. Los inversores pueden impacientarse esperando que se produzcan las separaciones anunciadas. Y algunas, incluso cuando lo hayan hecho, puede que no vean nunca mucho beneficio. Pero las cifras de estas grandes separaciones sugieren que los inversores esperarán -al menos hasta que se completen las rupturas-.

Aug. 31--An investment fund controlled by billionaire George Soros has significantly boosted its stake in Minneapolis-based Target Corp.
Soros Fund Management in New York, whose portfolio is worth more than $7 billion, purchased 543,900 shares of Target stock in the second quarter, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Overall, Soros owns 552,600 shares, or 0.08 percent of the retailer, which the investment firm valued at $25.9 million, the filing says. (State Street Corp., Target's largest investor, owns 63.5 million shares, or 9.4 percent of the company.)
In an e-mail, Soros spokesperson Michael Vachon declined to comment.
Known for his outspoken politics, Soros has established himself as a savvy investor, especially with currencies. In one of his most famous exploits, Soros in 1992 shorted $10 billion worth of the British pound, betting correctly that Great Britain would allow the currency to devalue in relation to other currencies such as the German mark.
"When Soros takes a stake, it certainly draws attention" like Warren Buffett, said Glenn Johnson, a portfolio manager with Mairs & Power in St. Paul, which owns 2.7 million shares of Target stock. "But what are Soros' real intentions? Who knows?"
Unlike activist investor William Ackman, who recently abandoned his effort to force Target to sell and lease back the land beneath its stores, Soros is a longer-term investor whose holdings include AT&T, Boeing and Kraft Foods.
Soros is betting on Target stock, even though the fund is generally bearish on retail. In the second quarter, the fund bought additional shares in Ralph Lauren (494,244) and Lowe's (298,000) but also reduced its retail holdings, including Macy's (-121,700), JCPenney (-12,300), and Amazon.com (-280,655).
Target's second-quarter profit rose 3.7 percent to $704 million, or $1.03 a share, beating Wall Street estimates by 6 cents a share. Earlier this month, Target said sales at stores open for at least a year rose a solid 3.7 percent, thanks to sales of food, housewares and health and beauty. Target executives have said back-to-school sales were off to a good start.
Target stock has languished this year, dropping about 16 percent. Johnson, however, says Target's stock decline has more do to with broader worries about the economy.
"We certainly like the direction the company is going," said Johnson of Mairs & Power, which purchased an additional 91,382 Target shares in the second quarter. "We have a high degree of confidence in their longer-term outlook and we saw this as an opportunity to buy more shares at an attractive price."
The stock traded at an average price of $48.97 in the second quarter. Shares closed Tuesday at $50.96, which suggests Soros has already made a positive return on his investment.

Nearly a third of Central Florida children may lack adequate nutrition

Aug. 31--The latest numbers are out on how many Americans struggle to get enough nourishing food to eat -- and the news isn't good for Central Florida's children.
In six area counties -- Orange, Osceola, Seminole, Lake, Brevard and Volusia -- from 25 percent to 31 percent of kids are what the government calls "food insecure." That means more than 190,000 children live in families that sometimes go hungry, don't know where their next meal is coming from or have to rely on cheap, nutritionally sparse food to fill their stomachs -- something that, ironically, can lead to childhood obesity.
"It can cost a lot of money to eat healthy," said Dave Krepcho, president and CEO of Second Harvest Food Bank of Central Florida. "Put yourself in the place of a single mom, working full time at a minimum-wage job, and you get to the third or fourth week of the month and maybe you have 20 or 30 bucks left. Are you going to buy fresh strawberries at $4.99 a basket or three boxes of mac and cheese mix? You want to keep your children's bellies from rumbling."
The latest data on the problem, compiled by the national nonprofit Feeding America, for the first time details food insecurity among Americans younger than 18 on a county-by-county basis. The agency's report shows Steele County, N.D., had the lowest rate of food-insecure children -- at 7 percent -- while Zavala and Starr counties, both in Texas, had the highest rates at more than 50 percent.
In Central Florida, counties ranged from 25.4 percent in Seminole to 30.8 percent in Osceola.
Overall, the figures add up to about 12 million kids nationwide, many of them in the South.
Experts consider adequate nutrition particularly important for developing brains and bodies, and some studies have linked poor diet to stunted intellectual development and poor school performance. Other studies, the Feeding America report says, "show the health consequences of food insecurity among children, including increased illness and higher associated health costs."
To help alleviate the difficulties among Central Florida families, Second Harvest rolled out a new mobile pantry last week. Paid for by a grant from Kraft Foods, the 25-foot refrigerated truck will take fresh fruits, vegetables and other nutritious foods to schools and faith-based organizations throughout Orange, Osceola and Seminole counties, supplementing the canned foods and breads that are often the staples of pantry programs.
"Without programs like this, it's really hard," said 26-year-old Heidi Thompson, pushing her infant son in a stroller as she lined up Tuesday for the mobile pantry's second stop, at Bithlo's New Covenant Church of Central Florida. "We have to budget very carefully, and we still need government assistance."
Thompson works part-time at Denny's while going to college to become a labor and delivery nurse. Her husband, a former construction laborer, became an electrician when the housing boom collapsed, but he still struggles to get enough hours. They have another son who is 4 1/2.
"I don't really need to eat a lot," Thompson said, explaining how her family manages. "I make sure my children have enough first."
Beth Atkinson, 44, a single mother of three teens, admired a bounty of fresh corn, tomatoes, cantaloupe, berries and other produce even as she pitched in as a volunteer. It was her way of giving back to the church-run Harvest of Hope food pantry, which is one of the agencies to which Second Harvest distributes food.
"My family would not eat without this program," she said.
Dozens of families kept the line of recipients moving for several hours.
At the truck's first stop, last week at Pine Crest Elementary School in Sanford, Krepcho expected 200 to 400 people to show up after teachers and local community groups spread the word. Instead, there were 1,200. Some waited in the heat for hours to get fresh blueberries, carrots, lettuce and watermelon.
"There really are a lot of children that are hungry," said Principal Dianne Lebruto. This year, 86 percent of her 800 students qualify for the federal free and reduced-cost meal program, which provides both breakfast and lunch. At last count, 73 families were homeless.
Often, she said, "the only meals many children eat are the ones they have on campus."

CHICAGO, Aug. 31, 2011 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The first annual review of the state of diversity in the legal profession from the Institute for Inclusion in the Legal Profession clearly points to a serious problem in the pipeline, despite numerous programs, studies and individual efforts to effect change in the representation of diverse groups in the profession. The review shows that the legal profession continues to lag behind others with slow progress and that minority lawyers take different career paths.
Highlights of the study include:
Minority representation in the profession has grown from 9.7% in 2000 to 11.6% in 2009.
Women now compose 43.4 percent of the profession, but are underrepresented into top level jobs such as partner (19.4 percent), federal appellate judge (26.8 percent) and law school dean (20.6 percent).
African Americans are the best represented minority group at 4.7 percent, but their entry into the profession has slowed in recent years.
Minority and women's representation among law graduates has dropped slightly in recent years.
Employment patterns for white and minority law graduates have converged since the late 1990s, except for judicial clerkship rates, where the divergence has increased.
Women's initial employment continues to lag from men's among both white and minority law graduates; women are less likely than men to enter private practice and business.
African Americans and Native Americans continue to be significantly less likely than other groups to enter private practice; Asian Americans are more likely than other groups, including whites.
Lawyers with disabilities are less likely than other groups to enter private practice, and significantly more likely to enter public interest jobs.
Women are more likely than men to go into public interest jobs.
The percentage of LGBT lawyers is small, but increasing.
These new demographics in the review were compiled and analyzed by Prof. Elizabeth Chambliss, co-director, Center for Professional Values and Practice, at New York Law School. As editor-in-chief of the review, she has brought together a number of outstanding lawyers and commentators to provide detailed analysis, digging deep into the facts to examine the data in an effort to identify new approaches to seeking solutions and increasing diversity in the profession. These essays examine common elements in diversity and inclusion and focus on the important differences and unique challenges across groups. Essayists include Melinda S. Molina, Capital University Law School; Takeia R. Johnson, a practicing lawyer in Indianapolis with Frost Brown Todd LLP; Kathleen Dillon Narko, Northwestern University School of Law; Lawrence R. Baca, former deputy director, Office of Tribal Justice of the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division; Jacob Herring, Creative Cultural Changes LLC, Sarah Olson, Professional Development and Diversity Director, Wildman Harrold Allen & Dixon LLP; and others in private practice and academic settings. Chambliss' analysis points out that better data are needed to advance the analysis beyond general comparisons and she urges the legal profession to provide better general and ethnic breakdowns across the profession and across various subgroups.
"The IILP Review is a comprehensive and thoughtful document that will help us better understand the facts and provide a basis for candid discussion about individual experiences. Some of the data is encouraging - some troubling - but a shared understanding of the data and a continued focus on the facts and figures is essential to finding, and fixing, problems. The essays are a must read as we begin a national dialogue to chart a course for the future," said Marc S. Firestone, chair of IILP and executive vice president, corporate and legal affairs, and general counsel, Kraft Foods, Inc. "The review reinforces data we found earlier that showed we had a long way to go to realize success in fostering diversity in business. The symptoms are there, we need to find an effective cure."
Noting that a shared conversation about diversity and inclusion has been difficult to sustain, Chambliss urges more communication and coordination of pipeline and other efforts to make it easier for busy lawyers, judges, law professors, students, employers and diversity professionals to stay current on the latest thought trends, research programs and challenges facing the profession.
The IILP is hosting seminars in several cities around the country throughout the fall featuring discussion of the data and presentations by several of the authors with a focus on local solutions and programs that meet the needs of the community. Headlining the sessions will be a thought-provoking presentation by Stuart Buck, doctoral fellow, Department of Education Reform, University of Arkansas and the author of the book, Acting White: The Ironic Legacy of Desegregation. Sessions are scheduled for Sept. 7 in San Francisco; Sept. 9 in Seattle; Sept. 20 in New York City; Sept. 21 in Washington, D.C.; Oct. 4 in Houston; and Oct. 26 in Chicago.
About the Institute for Inclusion in the Legal Profession Through its programs, projects, research, and collaborations, the Institute for Inclusion in the Legal Profession is dedicated to improving diversity and promoting inclusion in the legal profession. IILP is a leader in supporting new approaches and inventing and testing methodologies that will lead to real change and eliminate bias in the legal field. Through comprehensive outreach and original programming, IILP works closely with legal, judicial, professional, educational and governmental institutions to help the profession advance diversity as a core value.

NEW YORK, Aug. 31, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- As students across the United States head back to school, Euro RSCG Worldwide thought it was time for the nation as a whole to get a report card--on modern life. So we asked a random and representative sample of American adults online to grade 14 important aspects of their own life. And against expectations, despite all the gloom-and-doom media headlines that routinely characterize every aspect of public life in the U.S., many Americans are scoring good grades in their personal life.
In fact, majorities of Americans give themselves top-two-box grades (as with school report cards, those are "A" and "B") in 10 of the 14 dimensions that we explored. Is this another case of grade inflation, or maybe whistling in the dark?
Matt Ryan, Chairman of Euro RSCG New York, gets to the heart of this public-private paradox: "Looking at these findings, we must ask how it is that so many Americans are rating their life so well when there is so much angst in the air. We suspect the answer comes down to perspective. When Americans look at the big picture, they see unremitting angst and feel powerless to do much about it. When they are asked to focus on specific areas in their own life, however, the picture changes and they feel more positive--possibly a case of counting their blessings."
Among the intriguing findings:
There's a yawning gender divide on stress management: Sixty-two percent of men score it A or B, versus just 42 percent of women.
There's a gender gap on weight management, too, with 54 percent of men scoring A or B, versus 39 percent of women.
Likewise on physical health, more men score themselves A or B than women: 51 percent versus 45 percent.
On all 14 dimensions, Euro RSCG's proprietary Prosumers segmentation* scores more A or B than the average, especially on sense of control (75 percent versus 64 percent).
Only 42 percent of Americans score themselves A or B on finances/financial security, while 17 percent rate themselves D and 9 percent rate themselves F (fail).

Aug. 30--LUXEMBOURG -- I was about to climb aboard my connecting train in Basel, Switzerland, en route from Lucerne to Luxembourg on Tuesday when a woman from the railway informed me that the car I was entering was pretty full, so I might want to consider another one.
"But my reserved seat is on this one," I said.
She shook her head as if to say, "I'm sorry."
So on board I went, and there they were: the patrons.
OK, this is a pretty unruly bunch, at least if you count telling bad jokes as unruly, but they also represent a cross-section of Chicago's highest-end establishment, with three former Chicago Symphony Orchestra chairmen and people who have run banks, investment firms and Kraft Foods among them. Plus, their parallel travels with the CSO's two-week European tour is first class all the way, so I figured I could do worse than be their accidental appendage.
What's more, they shared their wine.
But this piece is not about the patrons, though I keep saying I'll get to them. (Maybe after tomorrow when I accompany them to a ceremony at the cemetery commemorating American soldiers lost in the Battle of the Bulge.) Let's wrap up some unfinished from Lucerne first.
The orchestra rehearsed Monday morning in Lucerne's modern concert hall where the festival concerts take place -- it's generally referred to by its initials, KKL, and I'll leave it at that. The first CSO concert there actually was Sunday night, the day they arrived from Salzburg, so music director Riccardo Muti and the musicians had to adjust on the fly to the contrasting acoustics between this tall, shoebox-shaped auditorium and Salzburg's fan-shaped Grosses Festspielhaus. (I'll also soon be writing more about different halls' acoustics, from the musicians' and audiences' points of view.)
Monday's rehearsal was supposed to run through Richard Strauss's "Aus Italien," which was having its only performance on this tour that night in Lucerne, and then a couple of short Verdi pieces being prepared as encores. But when musicians arrived, they found a curve ball in the schedule: Instead of the Verdi, they'd be rehearsing a piece that many (if not most) of them didn't know: Giuseppe Martucci's "Nocturne, Op. 70, No. 1."
Muti explained to the musicians and guests from the sister-city program between Lucerne and Chicago that Martucci was a superlative composer, conductor and pianist of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries whose work became overshadowed in part because Italian music at the time was dominated by opera from composers such as Puccini.
Muti said Mahler's final program as a conductor included a Martucci piece, and in the early 1930s famed conductor Arturuo Toscanini was supposed to conduct a memorial concert for him in Bologna, but Italian fascists demanded that he perform the fascist anthem at the beginning, Toscanini refused repeatedly and wound up being intercepted by thugs at the auditorium's doors and beaten, fleeing the country soon after. The concert, Muti said, never happened.
The softly flowing, string-driven nocturne was about 10 minutes long, and Muti ran the orchestra through it a couple of times, with a few suggestions. You (or at least I) would never have known the musicians hadn't been playing this for years. That's what makes 'em pros.
The concert that evening had a similarly triumphant feel to those that preceded it. The Hindemith Symphony in E-flat was energetically performed and received, and "Aus Italien," the then-young German composer's tribute to the conductor's native country, as performed in Switzerland by an American orchestra, offered a pleasing combination of rousing overture, lush melodicism and a lively final movement inspired by Neapolitan folk music.
For those keeping score at home, the ovation prompted Muti to come out for what's becoming a standard five bows, and although not enough audience members stood to qualify for the Standing O, during the third bow they did start in with the rhythmic clapping for the only time since the second night in Salzburg.
Instead of making his final exit after his fifth bow, Muti turned to address the audience and began telling them of a great composer about whom they'd probably never heard: one Giuseppe Martucci.
Someone in the audience tittered, and Muti said sternly, "It is nothing to laugh (at)."
Another cackle, perhaps a nervous one, came from the seats, and Muti stood there silently with a look that...well, let's just say, you don't want a parent or anyone else in authority looking this way at you. Tension hung in the silence. Would he take his baton and leave?
No, he wouldn't. "He was a great composer. He was a great conductor," Muti continued, telling of Brahms' and Mahler's support of him and of Toscanini and the fascists, all while the audience listened intently.
The encore went over as it should have, frosting on a rich cake, and after three more bows, the evening was done.
***
By the way, the reason the orchestra was playing "Aus Italien" and not its usual second-night centerpiece, Prokofiev's "Suite from 'Romeo and Juliet'"--aside from the Strauss piece being a favorite of Muti's as well as of the Lucerne Festival's head -- was that the Philadelphia Orchestra had preceded the CSO to town and played that Prokofiev work. Such are the complexities of booking a European tour; you not only must come up with workable dates but also must negotiate the repertoire amid many moving parts.As it turned out, when the CSO arrived in Lucerne, its charter jet was being picked up by the Philadelphia Orchestra to fly to its next stop. And the bus that transported the CSO musicians to their hotel had just been used to drive the Philadelphia musicians to the airport.
Given the tight-knitness of this rarified classical musician community, the Chicago and Philadelphia players left little messages for each other to find all over their respective buses and planes. Each party was pleased to find that these scraps of paper hadn't been cleared away before they boarded.
After all, with musicians of this caliber, you don't want to mess with their notes.
Europe's early reviews of the CSO are mixed
LUCERNE, Switzerland -- Critics are mostly applauding, though without the stomping or rhythmic clapping, for the first of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's performances on its two-week European tour.
Reviews of the weekend performances in Salzburg, Austria, generally acknowledge the power of the orchestra, particularly the oft-lauded brass section, but some take issue with ways in which that power is directed and music is interpreted by CSO music director Riccardo Muti.
The Vienna-based paper Der Standard praised the lyricism of the Prokofiev, but complained of languorous strings in Paul Hindemith's Symphony in E flat. Salzburger Nachrichten called Muti's take on Richard Strauss' "Death and Transfiguration" unsophisticated, with the orchestra lacking radiance, but admired the 70-year-old conductor and his orchestra's energy on the Hindemith, and praised the musicians' technical brilliance and large sound.
At the most negative end, the Austrian paper Wiener Zeitung found that the brass section overwhelmed the strings, and it characterized the orchestra's volume as a strategy to win applause. The Viennese paper Die Presse was far more enthusiastic, calling the brass section among the world's finest and marveling at how Muti, in his short tenure as music director, was already drawing such finesse and elegance from the strings.

CHICAGO, Aug. 30, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- The new age of vending has arrived, and the industry is taking its machines, products and technology on the road to showcase what the new consumer vending experience looks and feels like.
(Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20110830/CG60152)
Dubbed "The Gratitude Tour" and sponsored by the National Automatic Merchandising Association (NAMA), the traveling exhibit is designed to say "thank you" to loyal users of vending, especially Generation Y users (ages 18-29), who were shown in recent research to prefer vending over convenience stores and grocery/drug stores for snacks and cold beverages. Thousands of free products will be given away at the events.
The Gratitude Tour will visit seven cities in 2011, according to the following schedule:
Boston
Mon., Sept. 12
Prudential Plaza
11 a.m.-5 p.m.


New York City
Thurs., Sept. 15

11 a.m.-5 p.m.


"The days of digging for coins and waiting for your candy bar to drop into a bin are being replaced with a much more exciting, interactive experience," said Dan Mathews, Executive Vice President and COO of NAMA. "We now have machines that look and act like giant iPads(R), offer on-the-spot nutrition information and dispense bananas without a single bruise on them. Plus, who could have predicted even a few years ago that we could get fresh-spun cotton candy from a machine untouched by human hands, or 'gift' a Pepsi* to a friend who is miles away?"
Mathews also cited as an example the Diji-Touch machine, developed by Kraft Foods, Crane Merchandising Systems and Samsung Electronics. The Diji-Touch uses touch-screen technology to display a digital image of a product inside the machine, allowing consumers to interact with an enlarged, 360-degree view of the product (including all nutritional information and other product details) before making a purchase.
"While this type of technology is not yet ubiquitous, it absolutely represents the future of vending," added Mathews. He pointed out that the Gratitude Tour also features machines containing healthy snacks, in addition to machines that can "talk to each other" using high-tech telemetry to bundle multiple purchases from multiple machines.
"This technology means consumers can buy more than one snack and several beverages at the same time from different machines," Mathews explained, "and pay for it all at once with the convenient swipe of a credit/debit card, stored-value card, or mobile payment device."
In a recent NAMA research study, the majority of Gen Y respondents said they would choose vending over other retail options if all the options were equidistant. They also indicated a strong interest in new technologies and products emerging in vending. The research was instrumental in designing a high-tech yet consumer-friendly experience for the Gratitude Tour that all ages can enjoy.
The Gratitude Tour is the latest initiative by NAMA to capture consumer attention and educate the public about vending and all that it delivers today. Tour visitors can also learn about how vending is increasingly offering the convenience of cashless payment options, features technology that ensures greater machine reliability, and is often a better value than grocery or convenience stores.
The broader NAMA program aims to create a "vendialogue" between the industry and the public, encouraging consumers to actively communicate with the industry about products they would like to see offered at vending, plus new and different locations for vending machines.
Leading consumer product suppliers supporting the Gratitude Tour include PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Kraft Foods, Mars, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Dole, Hershey's, Kellogg's, Nabisco, Wrigley, Frito-Lay, Snyder's-Lance, Jack Links, General Mills, Cadbury, Pepperidge Farm, Nestle, AdvancePierre Foods and others.
Twenty state-of-the art vending machines are being provided by Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Starbucks/Seattle's Best, Kraft, VendEver Cotton Candy, Canteen Vending, Crane Merchandising Systems and U-Select-It. In addition, unattended retail markets by Company Kitchen and Avanti Systems will be on display, as well as a vending payment technology exhibit by MEI. Other vending industry leaders supporting the Gratitude Tour include G&J Marketing, Canteen Vending/Compass Group and Vistar. (See detailed fact sheets on featured machines and products for more information.)
Admission to Gratitude Tour events and all products at the events are free to the public. "We want people of all ages to attend our events, experience the new machines and enjoy the giveaways," Mathews said. In addition, local bands and musicians will provide free entertainment, and Tour-goers can stop by the social media tent where anyone can enter a fun and easy Facebook contest to win cash prizes (visit http://www.facebook.com/vendlovewin to learn more).
*Using digital technology, PepsiCo's Social Vending System enables any user to gift a friend by selecting a beverage and entering the recipient's name, mobile number and a personalized text message. The gift is delivered with a system code and instructions to redeem it at any PepsiCo Social Vending system.

Members from the 2011 ranking come from politics, business, media, entertainment and non-profit sectors and were ranked by three metrics: dollar, a traditional and social media component, and power base points.


FULL TEXT
---------

(SINGAPORE) German Chancellor Angela Merkel was ranked the world's most powerful woman in Forbes magazine's annual listing yesterday, displacing US First Lady Michelle Obama, who slid seven spots to eighth this year.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton moved into the second spot, followed by Dilma Rousseff, who became Brazil's first female president this year.
Temasek Holdings chief executive Ho Ching was the only Singaporean to appear on the top 100 list and is ranked 72nd. She was listed 30th most powerful woman and 10th under the business category last year.
Ms Ho has been executive director at the investment agency since May 2002 and chief executive since January 2004.
For the financial year ended March 31, the group's net profit rose to $13 billion from $5 billion the previous year.
Temasek Holdings also saw the net value of its investment portfolio rise to a record high of $193 billion end-March, from $186 billion a year earlier, an increase of 4 per cent.
The bulk of Temasek's investments continues to reside in Asia, which comprised 77 per cent of its portfolio exposure at end-March, including 32 per cent exposure in Singapore.
Another Singaporean, Singapore Telecommunications group chief executive Chua Sock Koong, who was ranked 71st most powerful woman, and 25th in business last year, was dropped from the list this year. She was the only other Singaporean to make it to the list last year.
This year saw 15 Asians make it to the top 100, versus seven last year. Three Asians made it to the list for the first time.
Ms Merkel, who has topped the list in all but one year since she became chancellor in November 2005, was called the 'undisputed leader of EU' and 'key to curing what ails the eurozone' by Forbes.
The 57-year-old politician led the list from 2006 to 2009 before being bumped back to fourth place last year by Mrs Obama, Kraft Foods chief executive Irene Rosenfeld and media personality Oprah Winfrey.
'Although overseeing a booming economy and falling unemployment, she contends with a weakening support base and crisis in the eurozone, where Germany is often in the unenviable position of bailing out its weaker neighbours.
'She is out to stabilise EU debt and keep the 17-member eurozone unified,' Forbes said of Ms Merkel.
Members from the 2011 ranking come from politics, business, media, entertainment and non-profit sectors and were ranked by three metrics: dollar, a traditional and social media component, and power base points.

Aug. 25--Agro Farma, manufacturers of Chobani yogurt, have been named to the SBA 100.
The list, compiled by the U.S. Small Business Administration, features 100 businesses that have created at least 100 jobs since receiving SBA assistance, according to SBA.gov.
Turkish immigrant Hamdi Ulukaya received an SBA loan in 2005 to purchase the 80,000-square-foot former Kraft Foods plant in New Berlin, where he began producing yogurt for various companies.
Agro Farma's own brand of Chobani Greek-style yogurt debuted in 2007 with fewer than 50 employees working at the plant. The company expanded in 2010, adding a warehouse for on-site storage and adding jobs.
Today, the plant employs 670 people on three full-time shifts, producing 1.2 million cases of yogurt each week.
The company received $18 million in federal new market tax credits in July to expand locally and to acquire an Australian manufacturer and distributor.
Agro Farma said it expected to create as many as 450 full-time jobs with the proposed expansion, but did not offer many details.

Residents urged to heed evacuation orders.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 25, 2011 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Hurricane Irene is headed toward the East Coast and the American Red Cross is mobilizing disaster workers and equipment along much of the eastern seaboard to help those in the path of this powerful storm.
(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090108/RedCrossLOGO)
Hurricane Irene is predicted to be the largest storm to hit the East Coast in more than 70 years, and could threaten several big population centers. A hurricane watch has been issued for the North Carolina coast and the Red Cross has opened shelters in the state as evacuation orders go into effect. In addition, more than 200 Red Cross mobile feeding vehicles are heading towards the coast to help people in the path of the storm.
"The Red Cross is moving volunteers, vehicles and supplies, getting ready for a response effort that spans nearly the entire East Coast," said Gail McGovern, president and CEO of the American Red Cross. "While we're getting ready at the Red Cross, we want everyone in the storm's path to get ready as well by getting a disaster kit, making a family emergency plan, and listening to local officials regarding evacuations."
Dozens of shelters are being prepared all along the East Coast. People can find open Red Cross shelters by viewing an interactive Google map at www.redcross.org or by downloading the free Red Cross shelter app for their iPhone from the iTunes store. A mobile-friendly version of the Hurricane Safety Checklist is now available for smart phone users to download at www.redcross.org/mobile.
It's important that those affected by the storm stay in contact with loved ones and the Red Cross Safe and Well website can help them do that. Safe and Well is a secure, easy-to-use online tool to help families connect in an emergency. People can register by visiting the Red Cross web site or calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767).
A hurricane watch means hurricane conditions could be a threat within 48 hours. An upgrade to a hurricane warning will mean hurricane conditions are expected within 36 hours. Those in the affected area should finish their storm preparations and evacuate if authorities ask them to do so.
Hurricane Irene has caused significant damage in the southern Bahamas and the Bahamas Red Cross is managing shelters and helping people displaced by the storm. A regional disaster management expert is headed to the Bahamas today to assist with disaster assessment and response. In the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Red Cross is mobilizing volunteers as flooding, damage to homes and impassable roads are left in the storm's wake. The United Nations is reporting hundreds of homes have been damaged and it is difficult to communicate with many localities.
In addition, Irene could affect blood collections along the East Coast at a time when the nation's blood supply is already low. The Red Cross is urging those who are eligible to give blood prior to the storm's arrival. Donating blood now, before the storm, will help ensure blood is available in the aftermath of Irene should conditions prohibit people from traveling to blood collections.
Individuals who are 17 years of age (16 with parental permission in some states), meet height and weight requirements (110 pounds or more, depending on their height), and who are generally in good health may be eligible to donate blood. To schedule an appointment, please call 1-800-RED CROSS or visit us online at www.redcrossblood.org.
Red Cross Annual Disaster Giving Program (ADGP) members support Red Cross disaster efforts by pledging donations to the Red Cross in advance of major disasters to ensure an immediate response to help people affected. ADGP members responsible for these generous donations include 3M, Altria Group, Aon, Caterpillar, Cisco Foundation, ConAgra Foods, Costco Wholesale Corporation, Darden Restaurants, Inc., Dr Pepper Snapple Group, FedEx Corporation, GE Foundation, The Home Depot Foundation, John Deere Foundation, Kimberly-Clark Corporation, Kraft Foods, Lowe's Companies, Inc., Merck, Morgan Stanley, Nationwide Insurance Foundation, Northrop Grumman, Optum, Ryder Charitable Foundation, Southwest Airlines, State Farm, State Street Foundation, Target, The TJX Companies, Inc., UnitedHealthcare, UPS and Walmart.
American Red Cross disaster preparedness starts long before a hurricane makes landfall, beginning with keeping supplies and equipment on stand-by all year to help people in need. On average, the Red Cross spends about $450 million on disaster relief every year. If someone would like to support Red Cross disaster efforts, they can make a donation to American Red Cross Disaster Relief by visiting www.redcross.org, calling 1-800-RED CROSS, texting the word REDCROSS to 90999 to make a $10 donation, or sending contributions to their local Red Cross chapter or to the American Red Cross, P.O. Box 37243, Washington, DC 20013.
About the American Red Cross:The American Red Cross shelters, feeds and provides emotional support to victims of disasters; supplies nearly half of the nation's blood; teaches lifesaving skills; provides international humanitarian aid; and supports military members and their families. The Red Cross is a charitable organization -- not a government agency -- and depends on volunteers and the generosity of the American public to perform its mission.

Aug. 24--Though rain may have wiped out many of the morning events, a group of adamant volunteers still took part in United Way of Dane County's annual Days of Caring on Tuesday.
Carolyn, a 73-year-old who was left semi-paralyzed by a stroke five years ago, cherished the opportunity to tour the gardens with volunteers Carmen Faymomvile and Lisa Beckstrand.
"I was able to see and learn about a variety of flowers. My guide knew a lot about flowers because she's a gardener," Carolyn said. "It's a wonderful way to spend an afternoon." The State Journal is not publishing the full names of the seniors taking part in the program due to patient-hospital privacy agreements.
Faymomvile and Beckstrand were part of a team from UW System administration that spent Tuesday afternoon walking a group of 10 seniors from St. Mary's Adult Day Health Care Center through Olbrich Gardens on Madison's East Side.
"It felt like we were all contributing," Faymomvile said of her stroll through the gardens with Carolyn and Beckstrand. "We were learning from each other. I wish we could, as an office, do more of this."
The United Way of Dane County and Oscar Mayer/Kraft Foods kicked of Days of Caring on Tuesday. The volunteer campaign continues through Thursday and reaches out to agencies and businesses in the area, urging them to get employees involved in community projects, said Sarah Listug, a spokeswoman for United Way of Dane County.
Listug said the group is aiming for 3,000 volunteers donating 12,000 hours of service over the three days and will reschedule the projects rained out Tuesday morning.
The United Way campaign follows news from the Corporation for National and Community Service, which ranked Madison the sixth-best mid-sized city in America for residents giving time to nonprofits and other community organizations.

According to a 13 July re- - search report by Ekspres Yat- irim Menkul Degerler AS, a Turkish equity research firm, the biscuit industry in Turkey - is expected to grow at around 5% a year for the next five years--in line with the coun- - try's gross domestic product.

New Delhi, Aug. 24 -- Facing stiff competition on domestic turf, Indian biscuit makers are now looking to expand overseas by forming joint ventures (JVs) and acquiring companies.
While Parle Products Ltd is looking for a JV partner, an- other biscuit maker is looking to buy a company with distri- bution capabilities in Turkey, three persons close to both the deals said. They declined comment on the identity of the Turkish company.
Parle is looking at JVs and even investing in greenfield projects in emerging and de- veloping economies, said Pravin Kulkarnii, general manager (marketing) at Parle Products. He declined to pro- vide details of the planned in- vestments or JVs, but said the company is in preliminary talks with Religare Capital Markets Ltd, an investment bank, to look for assets over- seas.
A Religare Capital Markets executive, who did not want to be identified, said the bank is talking to some foreign companies on behalf of Indi- an biscuit makers, but de- clined to name any of them, citing confidentiality.
Mumbai-based Parle Prod- ucts, best known for its glu- cose biscuits brand Parle-G, gets less than 8% of its reve- nue of around '6,000 crore from exports and overseas markets, but Kulkarnii sees this growing to at least 12% of its revenue.
Britannia Industries Ltd, the maker of Vita MarieGold, Tiger and NutriChoice, has also stepped up investments in its overseas subsidiaries.
In fiscal 2011 (FY11), the company raised its stake in Dubai-based Strategic Foods International Co. Llc and Al Sallan Food Industries Co.
SAOG (based in Sohar, Sultanate of Oman) from 70% to 100%.
Britannia has inducted a new chief executive for Strate- gic Foods, said Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers Ltd in a July 22 report. Overseas revenue account ed for 15-18% of Britannia's '4,213 crore revenue in FY11 according to Mehul Desai, an alyst at Kisan Ratilal Choksey Shares and Securities Pvt. Ltd.
"Biscuit companies are looking at emerging, develop ing and neighbouring markets for growth," said Desai. He added that Britannia was al NT ready the second largest bis cuits company in West Asia and that the company would look at further strengthening its position in that market.
The foreign focus comes a a time when competition in the Indian biscuits market '15,000 crore by sales, is in creasing on account of the en try of multinational compa nies and the presence o strong local firms in regiona markets.
Last year, Kraft Foods Inc launched Oreo, and United Biscuits, the makers of McVi tie's biscuits, too, entered the segment.
The unidentified biscui maker is looking at a distribu tion platform in Turkey which is a high-growth mar ket, said an investment bank er. "The company will eithe o buy a distribution channel o a small but significant firm in a the Turkish market," the - banker said, asking not to be i identified.
He added the firm could spend anything between $50 - million and $100 million ('230-460 crore).
According to a 13 July re- - search report by Ekspres Yat- irim Menkul Degerler AS, a Turkish equity research firm, the biscuit industry in Turkey - is expected to grow at around 5% a year for the next five years--in line with the coun- - try's gross domestic product.
There are around 30 manu- facturers with the two largest owning an 84% share of the market.
According to a second in- t vestment banker, the Indian market is highly saturated , and competitive, and the - growth markets are South- - East and West Asia, Turkey, - South America and other developing economies.
"The cost of production in India is lower. The quality of . produce is very high and hence getting into a smaller - market with a distribution platform and scaling it up gives a headstart to compa- t nies in newer markets," added - this person, who did not want , to be named.

NORTHFIELD, Ill., Aug. 24, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- After a stellar rookie campaign in 2010, Kraft Foods (NYSE: KFT) will attempt to bowl over its record-setting results in the sophomore season of its largest branded hunger relief initiative, the Kraft Foods' Huddle to Fight Hunger. Through the campaign, Kraft Foods and several of their iconic brands are on a mission to help donate 25 million meals to Feeding America(R) - an increase of four million meals from 2010's record-setting efforts.
Huddle to Fight Hunger builds upon Kraft Foods' nearly 30-year relationship with Feeding America, the nation's leading domestic hunger-relief organization, to help fight hunger in the United States. Unfortunately, hunger remains a quiet but prominent issue in this nation, as more than 50 million Americans - one in six of our neighbors - live in food insecure households.
To spread the word, Kraft Foods has enlisted high profile partners and personalities to champion the cause, including dozens of retailers across the country, American Youth Football (AYF), celebrity chefs Pat and Gina Neely, football legend Joe Montana and several other football greats. The program will once again culminate at the popular Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl, which will be broadcast live on ESPN from AT&T Park in San Francisco on New Year's Eve. The game, which last year sold out for the fourth time in five years, will feature Army and a team from the Pac-12.
To reach their aggressive goal, Kraft Foods is rallying communities to join their iconic brands in the Huddle to Fight Hunger on Facebook. Americans can become part of the team at www.Facebook.com/KraftFightHunger - for each "Like," Kraft Foods will donate the monetary equivalent of one meal to a local Feeding America food bank(1). In addition, more than 60 retailer partners from coast-to-coast are huddling to support the campaign and raise additional meal donations for Feeding America via Huddle to Fight Hunger customized programming and in-store displays.
"Huddle to Fight Hunger builds upon three things Americans are passionate about... football, food and helping others," said Stephen Chriss, Senior Director, Consumer Engagement and Marketing Partnerships, Kraft Foods. "By leveraging our flagship brands, as well as big stages like the Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl and iconic partners, we hope to inspire America to join our huddle and help us tackle this serious issue."
"We thank our longtime partners at Kraft Foods for continuing the Huddle to Fight Hunger program," said Vicki Escarra, President and CEO of Feeding America. "The aggressive goal of donating 25 million meals, as well as the efforts to educate Americans about the issue of hunger in our country, is exemplary of Kraft Foods' ongoing commitment to support our efforts to end hunger in America."
A Deep Bench
Joining Kraft Foods' huddle are some of the company's biggest superstar brands including Planters nuts, Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers, Capri Sun beverages, Oscar Mayer meats, Maxwell House coffee, Kraft Real Mayo Mayonnaise, Miracle Whip Dressing, Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and Kraft cheese. These flagship brands all have an equal role in fighting this domestic issue and helping inspire people to support the cause.
Hunger In America
Hunger remains a serious issue in the United States. Leading the fight against hunger is Feeding America who serves an estimated 14 million children. Through its network of more than 200 food banks and 61,000 agency partners, Feeding America helps provide meals to more than 37 million Americans annually.

The Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl will pair Army (provided the Cadets meet or exceed six victories) against the sixth selection from bowl-eligible Pacific-12 schools.

Aug. 23--Pearson Candy Co., maker of such Minnesota favorites as the Salted Nut Roll and the Nut Goodie, has been sold to a private equity firm in a deal that could bolster the venerable St. Paul confectioner's business.
Greenwich, Conn.-based Brynwood Partners announced Monday that it will buy Pearson for an undisclosed price. It plans to keep operating the 102-year-old candy maker's W. 7th Street plant, which employs about 170, and use Pearson as a vehicle for future candy acquisitions.
Larry Hassler, Pearson's owner since 1985, began shopping Pearson last year as he contemplated retirement. Now 65, Hassler took over the firm when it was in financial ruins. He stabilized it, and then steadily grew revenue and profits, building a national market in the process.
While Pearson has been "an absolute passion," Hassler said, "I have taken the company as far as I can without acquisitions and massive advertising. ... It needs new ideas, new blood and new products."
Brynwood, which has other candy industry investments, has more capability to boost ad spending and increase Pearson's product breadth, Hassler said. "They want to use this as a base plant to bring in more production capacity."
Hassler will remain with the company in a consulting role during the ownership transition. Michael Keller, former chief marketing officer at Edina-based International Dairy Queen, will become Pearson's president and chief executive officer.
Brynwood Partners manages over $500 million in client funds and has done several consumer products deals in recent years, including the 2007 purchase of the classic Turtles candy brand from Nestle.
Turtles is now part of Brynwood's DeMet's Candy Co., and Brynwood has since bought the TrueNorth nut-cluster snack from PepsiCo and Balance Bar from Kraft Foods.
Private equity firms like Brynwood usually hold brands or companies for several years and then resell them after increasing their value.
At Pearson, "Our plan is to operate the business as it's currently configured and hopefully -- by adding fresh capital and new ideas to the business -- to grow it in the coming years," said Henk Hartong III, Brynwood's senior managing partner and Pearson's new chairman.
"We admire what Larry Hassler has done with the business and think we can build on the great work he has done," Hartong said. Brynwood sees Pearson as "a great platform for additional [candy] acquisitions."
Bob Boutin, of the suburban Chicago-based candy consulting firm Knechtel Laboratories, said Pearson is "very stable, very well respected and very conservatively run."
Indeed, Hassler said he passed on acquisitions over the years because of his financial conservatism.
Turnaround worked
Hassler, who grew up in Pennsylvania about an hour's drive from candy kingpin Hershey, became chief financial officer at Pearson in 1980, during a difficult period for the company.
The Pearson family had sold the business in 1969 to a big baking company unfamiliar with the candy trade. It unloaded Pearson's in 1979 to a confectionery partnership that didn't make things any better.
With Pearson facing bankruptcy or closure in 1985, Hassler and another Pearson employee, Judy Johnston, bought the company -- at a minimum cost -- at the suggestion of its largest creditor. Johnston sold her minority stake in November in anticipation of Pearson's ultimate sale, Hassler said.
Pearson spent five to eight years righting the ship before the company began growing again, Hassler said. Since then, "just about every year, revenues have been growing and earnings have been good."
Pearson's core market is Minnesota, the Dakotas, Wisconsin and Iowa, though it also has strong sales in Utah and Colorado. While Nut Goodie is a regional candy bar, Pearson's Salted Nut Roll and its chocolate-covered mints compete nationally with Hershey's Payday bar and its York-brand mints.
During Hassler's stewardship, Pearson made big strides in cracking national markets, landing accounts with Walgreen's, Supervalu-owned stores and retail titan Wal-Mart. National business accounts for 50 to 60 percent of the company's sales, Hassler said.
Pearson's revenue is below $100 million, and Hassler said candy makers below that level have difficulty surviving without more products to offer.
"The biggest question I get from customers is "what else do you have, what do you have coming?" Hassler said.
Pearson has plenty of capacity to make more candy at its St. Paul plant, he said. "We could double throughput without adding a brick."

Aug. 18--Double Stuf just wasn't enough. Northfield-based Kraft Foods introduced the Triple Double Oreo at grocery stores Wednesday, packing three layers of cookie and alternating layers of vanilla and chocolate cream into an extra-crunchy, 100-calorie snack. For those who can stop at one anyway.
It's the latest twist on the nearly 100-year-old iconic Oreo, the world's best-selling cookie, with more than $1.5 billion in annual sales, according to Kraft. The company said Oreo sales were up 22 percent during the first half of 2011, compared with the same period a year ago.
Lisa Mann, a Kraft vice president of marketing responsible for Oreo in the U.S., said parents and children are the primary targets for the cookie because of the "twist, lick, dunk" ritual central to its advertising. The fun thing about the new cookie, she said, is that with the extra layer, there are choices where to start eating.
But given the attention Triple Double has received, Mann said, Kraft expects some interest from new or lapsed customers as well.
"We were just stunned at the buzz and excitement that we were getting from new media and comedians months before we even launched," she said.
The cookie is a take on Argentina's Oreo x3 cookie, introduced last year, with banana and dulce de leche filling. Kraft's Nabisco division will begin promoting the Triple Double in September, with TV ads featuring Shaquille O'Neal, Eli Manning, Venus Williams and Apolo Anton Ohno.
At 4.5 grams of fat, the Triple Double isn't exactly light. Marisa Moore, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association, said consumers should think while eating.
"This is like eating two cookies," she said. "Before, you might have had two incorporated into your diet; now, you might want to consider having just one."
But the cookie isn't a cause for concern.
"No one's eating Oreos because they're good for you," Moore said. "We eat cookies because they taste good."
Jon Hauptman, a partner at Willard Bishop, a Barrington-based retail consulting firm, said the cookie is "a nice way to bring a little more energy to the cookie category." Since it's almost time for students to return to school, "it could be popular as an indulgent lunchbox treat," he added.
Through the years, Oreo has launched a variety of spinoffs on the Oreo. Some have been seasonal, like a Halloween version with orange cream. There's also a golden sandwich cookie with peanut butter filling.
Eating cookies is supposed to be fun for consumers, but it's big business for Kraft. The food giant describes Oreo, as well as other Kraft brands such as Chips Ahoy!, Trident, Tang and Jacobs Coffee, as central to its strategy of creating a $32 billion global snacking company next year as it splits off its $16 billion North American grocery business.
Oreo hasn't always been on a roll. In 2006, the brand's sales were lagging in the U.S., and the product was almost pulled in China, according to the company. Kraft increased marketing support in the U.S. and introduced a variety of culturally relevant products in China, like green tea ice cream filling for the chocolate sandwich cookie.
Kraft plans to build Oreo's presence in other developing markets. Last quarter, the company introduced Oreo to India.

Nice! touch comes to Walgreens shelves as store brands get makeover

Walgreen got a boost in developing the line after it acquired Duane Reade Holdings Inc., New York's biggest pharmacy chain, this year from private-equity firm Oak Hill Capital Partners in a deal valued at $1.1 billion.The transaction not only marked the biggest acquisition in the history of 109-year-old Walgreen but also gave the homespun company access to Duane Reade's well-developed, private label know-how at a time when consumers no longer look down on generic brands.

Aug. 18--So much for just sugar and spice. Walgreen is getting ready to make almost everything nice.
The nation's largest drugstore chain is set to unveil Thursday a new store brand called Nice! as it mothballs an assortment of a dozen in-house brands and refocuses its private-label strategy.
The Nice! brand name, two years in the making, began to appear on Walgreens store shelves last month on food products from soup to nuts. The rollout of more than 400 items, mostly grocery and paper products, is scheduled to accelerate this month and wind up at all 7,742 Walgreens and Duane Reade drugstores nationwide by January.
The move comes as retailers from Costco Wholesale Corp. to Macy's Inc. beef up their house brands as a way to stand out from their competitors, build a consumer following and boost profits. Not only do retailers generate higher profit margins on products they make and sell themselves, but the most successful store brands, among them Costco's Kirkland Signature and Trader Joe's, can generate a fan base that keeps returning to the stores.
"Over the past decade, private label has consistently become part of more and more retailers' assortments," said Paula Rosenblum, managing partner at Retail Systems Research, a Miami-based retail consulting firm. "The reason is simple. It's better gross margins. The challenge has become, can you create a strategy of it not being cheap?"
Walgreen Co. has no small ambitions for its Nice! line. The Deerfield-based chain brought in former Kraft Foods Inc. executive Maurice Alkemade in 2009 to create the program. Alkemade, a 14-year-Kraft veteran, most recently managed Kraft's business with Target. His goal at Walgreen: make Nice! a $1 billion-a-year brand.
"We want to manage it as a brand as opposed to managing it as a product," Alkemade said. "We want to treat it like a national brand, like the Krafts of the world do with their brands."
As part of the makeover, Walgreen is phasing out in-house brands, including Deerfield Farms, W, Cafe W, W Ultra and Chief Karlin. The Walgreens label will also disappear from food and household products but remain on health and wellness items.
Walgreen has a long history of making in-house brands, starting with its namesake Walgreens line launched more than 90 years ago. But the hodgepodge of private labels has grown unwieldy over the years, currently numbering 50 brands throughout the store.
That is one reason Alkemade favored going with a clean, no-frills, white background on the Nice! packaging with black lettering and a simple, vibrant silhouette of the product inside. The uncomplicated label stands out when it is placed on the shelf next to a sea of colored packages.
"Of all the names (we considered), this was different, catchy and the exclamation point added an emphasis," Alkemade said. And when it comes to creating advertising campaigns, "you can play with the word nice."
So far, Walgreen has rolled out roughly 20 products, including tea, dried fruit, rice, macaroni and cheese, honey, tomato sauce and baking soda. More items are planned to hit stores each month until the 400 target is reached in January.
Walgreen got a boost in developing the line after it acquired Duane Reade Holdings Inc., New York's biggest pharmacy chain, this year from private-equity firm Oak Hill Capital Partners in a deal valued at $1.1 billion.The transaction not only marked the biggest acquisition in the history of 109-year-old Walgreen but also gave the homespun company access to Duane Reade's well-developed, private label know-how at a time when consumers no longer look down on generic brands.
Total private-brand sales in the U.S. have increased from $64.9 billion in 2005 to $88.5 billion in 2010, according to A.C. Nielsen. The fastest-growing consumer segment buying store brands are households with annual incomes of more than $100,000, Nielsen said.
"We have a lot of opportunity to grow," Alkemade said. "We have very aspirational goals about where we want to take this."

Aug. 18--There's quite a beef, if you'll forgive the pun -- or bun-pun, now that I reconsider my words -- taking place in federal court in Chicago.
It's a full-fledged wiener war, but there ain't nothing weeny about it. Quite the contrary; millions of tube-steak dollars are at stake.
In one corner is the Sara Lee Corp., maker of Ball Park franks. In the other is Kraft Foods, Inc., which produces the Oscar Mayer brand.
Their furious food fight has been going on for three years. Thousands of pages of documents have been filed. I've read several news stories about the case, and if I understand everything correctly, it all boils down to two major issues:
One, what constitutes "100 percent pure beef" in the list of ingredients?
Two, which brand truly is "America's favorite?"
It's the second question that promises the most fireworks. Depending on how Judge Morton Denlow applies both the mustard and the rule of law, I can't help but wonder what other long-standing advertising claims could be affected.
Consider the jingle about a popular brand of coffee: "The best part of waking up is Folgers in your cup."
Says who?
As far as I'm concerned, the best part of waking up is realizing it's Saturday and drifting back to sleep.
What's more, if I were a mattress manufacturer, I might want to challenge Folgers' claim on the basis that the best part of waking up is being fully rested on my product.
How about "We do chicken right" from KFC?
All depends on who's in charge of the doing.
I'll guarantee PETA would maintain there is nothing whatsoever "right" about the slaughter of birds so Americans can grow even more obese at every meal.
Southwest Airlines touts the line, "You are now free to move about the country."
But what if you're in the rental car business and wish to encourage travelers to tour by auto instead of air? Shouldn't all parties be free to exercise that option?
Can't forget "What's in your wallet?" from Capitol One, either.
Whose business is that? Especially if you're an easy-to-embarrass teenage lad whose billfold shows the telltale ring of you-know-what. Perhaps Teenage Lads of America and the Trojan company should file a class-action lawsuit to stop this unwarranted intrusion.
And speaking of ceasing and desisting, I may encourage my fellow newspaper columnists to hire a lawyer and take on the folks at Hershey's.
Long before it became a chocolaty ad slogan, we lived and wrote by our proud motto: "Sometimes you feel like a nut; sometimes you don't."

Aug. 17--In a city that loves its hot dogs, the nation's top two wiener-makers battled in federal court Monday over dueling false advertising claims that have already underscored at least one frankfurter truism: Marketing sausage can be a lot like watching it being made.
Messy.
The trial stems from a 2009 lawsuit by Sara Lee Corp. over ads by Kraft Foods Inc. that claimed its hot dogs had won a national taste test and were "100 percent pure beef."
Kraft quickly filed its own countersuit, accusing Sara Lee of similar marketing no-nos, including boasting about its own "all beef" hot dog and misrepresenting a culinary award in touting its wieners as "America's best."
At stake in the legal battle is a $1.76 billion hot dog market dominated by Kraft's Oscar Mayer wieners and Sara Lee's Ball Park franks and whether either company's boasts crossed a line. The sales total doesn't include revenue from Wal-Mart and its club stores.
As the trial opened Monday in federal court in Chicago, lawyers for both Chicago-area food behemoths argued over such frank-marketing minutiae as the difference between meat and beef and whether a taste test could even be considered valid without such vital condiments as mustard.
Common ground seemed to lie only in puns, which proved irresistible to many in the courtroom.
Amid the heated hot dog talk, approximations became "ballpark" figures. An alleged disclosure was presented as a "frank" admission. And arguments naturally turned into "beefs."
"(I'm) trying to save one pun for the end of this," said Kraft attorney Stephen O'Neil, drawing a smile from U.S. Magistrate Judge Morton Denlow and chuckles from other lawyers.
But despite the occasional moments of levity, the openings statements by both sides brimmed with vitriol as only disputes between two fierce competitors can.
"Not in the entire history of American hot dogs" has a campaign of this scope been launched, Sara Lee attorney Richard Leighton said of Kraft's allegedly misleading advertising.
The filing of this lawsuit "was an act of utter hypocrisy," O'Neil volleyed back, alleging that Sara Lee's hot dogs had also been presented as "all beef" when they, too, contained other ingredients.
Although it's unusual for an advertising battle to result in a lawsuit, much less go to trial, the repercussions can be serious when a company is forced to revise or dismantle a marketing campaign that's already been aired in mass media or added to product packaging.
In 2004, Chicago provided the backdrop for an advertising debacle involving claims by Frito-Lay that Chicagoans preferred its potato chips to those of rival Jay's. The company was ultimately forced to cease the claims after a federal judge held that Lay's manipulated taste tests by labelings its chips as "classic" and Jays as "unflavored."
When companies go to court to resolve issues, it often comes down to raw emotion or desire for media attention, said Michael McSunas, an advertising lawyer with Chattanooga, Tenn.,-based Chambliss Bahner & Stophel.
"For whoever wins, it's not really going to affect sales," said McSunas, noting that most consumers were probably unaware of the short-lived hot dog ads. "(It) really speaks to how angry they are or how much publicity they want to get out of it."
Sara Lee has 22.5 percent of the national market, just ahead of Oscar Mayer's 20 percent, according to Chicago-based Symphony IRI, a market research firm.
The wiener war began after Northfield-based Kraft allegedly ran ads claiming "Oscar Mayer Jumbo Beef Franks beat Ball Park and Hebrew National in a national taste test."
Downers Grove-based Sara Lee said the ad and similar promotions that ran in magazines, stores and on the "Wienermobile" were misleading and based on an allegedly flawed taste test that didn't include condiment or bun choices, possibly affecting flavor.
Kraft denied the allegations and filed its own lawsuit against Sara Lee, alleging that the company was misusing an out-of-date ChefsBest award to promote its hot dogs as "America's best franks."
The 100-percent beef claim, Kraft contended, was never meant to imply there were no spices or preservatives used.
The advertising industry has long boasted of its ability to regulate itself. When competitors spar over claims, they usually appeal to the Federal Trade Commission's national advertising division. Parties agree to participate in the confidential process and abide by the decision. Generally, the body upholds an advertising claim, demands that a company make revisions or forces a company to withdraw the ad entirely.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also steps in occasionally to regulate health claims associated with food advertising. In 2009, the federal agency went after Cheerios for its claims that the oat cereal could, as part of a healthy diet, help reduce cholesterol.
"Before you put any claim out there, you need to make sure any claim that is made in an advertisement has been scrutinized internally and make sure it holds up," said Steve Gardner, president of Gardner Nelson Partners, a New York City-based advertising agency. Advertisers generally use market research to back up claims relating to consumer preference.
Part of the reason to be careful, Gardner said, is that "advertisers are vigilant to make sure they're aware of competitors' claims, what their claims are, the accuracy, often the stakes of those claims, and how they're interpreted by consumers."
So while it can become a legal issue, Gardner said that advertisers must also avoid overblown claims for fear of disappointing consumers who believe them.
Still, Tim Calkins, a clinical professor of marketing at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, wondered whether hot dog consumers would really be motivated by either Sara Lee and Kraft's claims when selling franks is usually about providing the lowest price.
"It's much more about the long-term competitive dynamic than the impact of one claim," he said.
Kraft has been closing the gap in recent years. In 2009, Kraft had 19.2 percent of the market to Sara Lee's 23.4 percent. Despite these commanding shares, the brands constitute a relatively small piece of Kraft, a $52.1 billion company, and even Sara Lee, an $8.7 billion company. Both Kraft and Sara Lee are in the process of splitting into smaller companies.
Judge Denlow, who will decide the case, indicated that he, at least, had apparently not been swayed by any of the advertising.
"I have already told you I have my own favorite hot dog," he said, "and it's none of the brands that are on trial."

EAST HANOVER, N.J., Aug. 17, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- After months of rumors, speculation, and excitement, the most anticipated cookie on the planet has finally arrived.
(Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20110817/CG53481)
In early May, word of the yet-to-be released TRIPLE DOUBLE OREO cookie reached the Internet and within hours, OREO fans were buzzing throughout social media about this new take on the iconic cookie. At long last, the wait is over. The TRIPLE DOUBLE OREO cookie, which combines two layers of OREO creme, one chocolate and one original, with three layers of crunchy, chocolaty OREO cookies, is available in stores nationwide.
"Our fans' passion and enthusiasm has challenged us to raise our game. With the TRIPLE DOUBLE OREO cookie, we set out to take OREO to another level by adding a new twist," said Jessica Robinson, associate director of consumer engagement, Kraft Foods. "We are looking forward to engaging with OREO fans as they share their twisting, licking and dunking moments with the new TRIPLE DOUBLE OREO cookie."
One Global Cookie, Many Unique 'Twists'
The new TRIPLE DOUBLE OREO cookie is another way in which OREO is creating fun new ways for people to enjoy the moment of childlike delight when twisting, licking and dunking an OREO cookie in milk. This iconic ritual is enjoyed throughout the world, from the United States to France to China. In fact, the TRIPLE DOUBLE OREO cookie is a new twist on Argentina's OREO "x3" (pronounced "Por Tres") cookie, introduced in 2010. Similar to the TRIPLE DOUBLE OREO cookie, the OREO x3 features three layers of cookie, and two layers of creme.
"The birthplace of OREO is America, but it's one global cookie," says John Ghingo, senior director of global marketing, OREO. "We're excited when we can take a popular idea in one country and share it with other OREO fans around the world. It's ideas like this that have made OREO the world's favorite cookie."
Team DSRL and OREO Fans Tackle TRIPLE DOUBLE OREO Challenge
To help launch the new cookie, the OREO Brand has enlisted the help of both OREO fans and Team DSRL, including Shaquille O'Neal, Eli Manning Venus Williams, Apolo Ohno and of course, Stufy, the DSRL mascot. New OREO Double Stuf Racing League TV advertising will begin airing in early September. DSRL veteran Shaquille O'Neal loves the challenge that the new cookie poses to his team, and wants to know if OREO fans are game.
"Now that I am retired I can spend more time perfecting my twist, lick and dunk skills, and with an added layer of creme and a third cookie, it's clear that I am going to need the practice," said O'Neal. "I am obviously the dunking expert, but I am working with the rest of Team DSRL to figure out the best way to compete with the TRIPLE DOUBLE OREO cookie."
Like O'Neal, OREO fans can start their own lick races with the new cookie now. The TRIPLE DOUBLE OREO cookie is available nationwide at grocery stores starting this week with a suggested retail price of $4.19 per package. One serving (1 cookie) is 100 calories and a total of 4.5g of fat.
Are You Game?
The DSRL celebrates the fun of bringing friends and families together in an exciting head-to-head competition to see who can twist, lick and dunk an OREO Double Stuf cookie and drink a glass of milk the fastest. But the TRIPLE DOUBLE OREO cookie has changed the game when it comes to how you twist, lick and dunk. Team DSRL wants to know.... Are you game?
In conjunction with the TV ads, OREO will launch a series of online games available at Oreo.com and Facebook.com/Oreo. Fans who participate could win the chance to win a trip to meet a member of Team DSRL.
The OREO Double Stuf Racing League officially launched in January 2008. To compete in a DSRL lick race, each person twists their cookie open and licks off all the creme. Then, each person shows their cookie to their opponent, dunks it, eats it and drinks the glass of milk. The first to finish twisting, licking and dunking wins!

PALO ALTO, Calif., Aug. 17, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- shopkick, the largest location-based shopping app that rewards shoppers simply for walking into stores, today celebrates a year since its launch with new partners, new categories of content and rewards, broad expansion of existing partners, and a new report on how American retailers, brands and shoppers have embraced location-based shopping. The company is unveiling the details at the American Eagle Outfitters flagship in Times Square today. AEO is one of shopkick's early launch partners, and hosted shopkick's initial launch party exactly one year ago.
The news includes:
The launch into content partnership with InStyle
A new pilot program with Toys"R"Us launching this fall
The Sports Authority's national rollout and performance metrics
Simon Property Group's (NYSE: SPG) expansion to Premium Outlets
New usage statistics, demographic information and business performance data
"When we launched, we made two promises. The first to the retailers and brands: that we could help drive more sales without heavy discounts like the daily deal sites. The second was to shoppers: that we could make their shopping experience more personal, rewarding and fun," said Cyriac Roeding, the co-founder of shopkick. "And in 12 short months, we've gone farther with the app than we'd ever imagined - delivering more rewards to more people from more partners in more locations."
With today's additions shoppers can earn "kicks" - shopkick's cross-partner currency - with ten retail partners, more than two-dozen brands, and two media partners. And it'll only continue to grow. Shoppers find that the kicks add up. Already, users have been awarded more than half a billion kicks, redeemed for iTunes gift cards, Facebook Credits, charitable donations, gift cards for partner stores and more.
New Partners:
As shopkick's first media content partner, InStyle will extend the magazine's content to shoppers on their smartphones. Shopkick's more than 2 million active users will have access to a "Shop By Color" virtual Pop-Up Store on shopkick. "Shop By Color" will offer users product recommendations and styling tips.
Shopkick also announced today that Toys"R"Us will launch a pilot program to bring shopkick's walk-in rewards and special deals to 100 select Toys"R"Us and Babies"R"Us stores in four markets - Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco -this fall. With this announcement, Toys"R"Us becomes the 10th partner in the network, which includes American Eagle Outfitters, Best Buy, Crate and Barrel, Macy's, Simon Property Group, The Sports Authority, Target, The Wet Seal and west elm along with brand partners such as HP, Intel, Kraft, Procter & Gamble, Unilever and dozens more.
By continuing to expand its list of partners in breadth and depth shopkick makes ubiquitous rewards available to shoppers throughout the purchase cycle - from advertisements, to the store, down to the aisle, and now through shopping-related content - exponentially increasing its value for users and partners.
Shopkick Promise Bears Out; Partners Expand
After less than a year in pilot, The Sports Authority (TSA) has decided to expand shopkick from 104 stores in four markets to the full national footprint of 470 stores.
"Our results with shopkick have been fantastic, with a return on investment in the top quartile of all our marketing programs," said Jeff Schumacher, Chief Marketing Officer of The Sports Authority. "We've also started to test shopkick promotions with key brand vendors, and the early results are positive. Good ROI, a great partnership and exciting opportunities with our customers' favorite products - how could we NOT build that into all our store programs?"
This 350% increase shows what a key role shopkick is playing in The Sports Authority's push to innovate in the digital space as it shifts toward a multi-channel marketing strategy.
"Shopkick is unique in the social/mobile space in that it has shopping at its core, with gaming and social mechanics layered on top. And the data we're seeing is proving the importance of that distinction - social and games at the core versus shopping at the core," said Clay Cowan, vice president, e-commerce and digital marketing at The Sports Authority. "This is a great fit with our customers, who love sports and games, and the results show it. We're fully committed to testing a wide range of social and mobile platforms, but when I look at our emerging channel portfolio, shopkick is at the front of the pack in terms of driving business results."
In addition to the TSA expansion, Simon Malls has decided to expand its shopkick partnership into all of its Premium Outlets because of how enthusiastically shoppers have embraced the program. These expansions mean that shopkick now offers walk-in rewards at nearly 3,000 stores and malls nationwide.
By the Numbers
With more than 2.2 million users, shopkick is the fastest growing location-based mobile shopping application. And the users are engaged:
Walking into partner stores more than 2 million times
Browsing more than 350 million items in the app
Scanning more than 7 million products from our partner brands
Picking more than 75,000 stores as favorites each day (more than 50 each minute!)
Who's Using Shopkick
Shopkick shoppers are the desired audience for its partner brands and retailers: 59% are women and 85% are between the ages of 20 and 60 years old.
How it Works
In order to provide high-value rewards to consumers for actual walk-ins, the shopkick app, combined with the shopkick Signal - an inaudible sound emitted from a patent-pending device located in each participating retailer - verifies a user is in-store. This ensures that marketing dollars put into the shopkick program are being spent to reward customers who are actually present in the store, something not possible with traditional location-based applications, which rely on GPS technology that has an error radius of 50-1,000 yards on mobile phones. And, because the detection occurs on the user's mobile device, the privacy of presence information is completely under the user's control.
Shoppers earn rewards through the shopkick app simply walking into the more than 2,500 retail and 160 mall locations that make up shopkick's Retail Partner Network and for interacting with partner brand products at 3 million stores nationwide. Walk-in rewards are currently available in all 50 states at select partner locations.
Launched in August 2010, shopkick quickly became the largest location-based shopping app in America and reached 2 million users within a record 11 months since its launch. The shopkick App is available for free on the iPhone from the App Store at www.itunes.com/appstore/ and on Android Market at http://shopkick.com/android.html
About shopkick, Inc.
shopkick, Inc. is a Palo Alto-based startup funded by Kleiner Perkins' iFund, Greylock Partners and Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn, and investor in Facebook and Zynga. In August 2010, shopkick launched the first mobile application that hands consumers high-value rewards, offers and exclusive deals at shopkick's national retail partners simply for walking into stores and malls. Even more rewards can be earned for scanning partner brand products at over 250,000 stores nationwide. In combination with a groundbreaking new location technology called "shopkick Signal", the app can verify location within feet, and because the detection occurs on the phone, privacy of presence information is completely in the users' control. Shopkick's growing partner alliance includes Best Buy, Macy's, Target, American Eagle, Crate & Barrel, The Sports Authority, Wet Seal, West Elm, Simon Property Group, Kraft Foods, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Intel, HP and The CW. Shopkick is the only 100% performance-based marketing platform in the physical retail world, with measurable foot traffic and transactions at stores. The app grew to 2 million users in its first 11 months. The free shopkick app is available for the iPhone and Android.

Aug. 16--The nation's two largest hot dog makers took their legal beefs today to federal court, where a judge will determine whether Oscar Mayer or Ball Park franks broke false-advertising laws in their efforts to become top dog.
As the bench trial got under way, U.S. District Judge Morton Denlow cast his eyes across the Chicago courtroom, where half a dozen attorneys were at opposing tables, and said: "Let the wiener wars begin."
The battle pits Chicago-area companies Sara Lee Corp., which makes Ball Park franks, against Kraft Foods Inc., which makes Oscar Mayer, in a case that could clarify how far companies can go when boasting that their product is better than a competitor's.
Despite the light-hearted remark by the judge, attorneys for the foodmakers struck a serious tone.
"There's never been anything of this scope . . . in the entire history of hot dogs," said Sara Lee's attorney, Richard Leighton, about what he described as Kraft's false and deceptive ad claims about making a better-tasting frank.
Sara Lee had fired the first volley in a 2009 lawsuit singling out Oscar Mayer ads that brag its dogs beat Ball Park franks in a national taste test. Leighton argued the tests were deeply flawed, including by serving the hot dogs to participants without buns or condiments.
"They were served boiled hot dogs on a white paper plate," he complained. He added that Sara Lee's hot dogs may well have tasted too salty or smoky eaten sans buns.
Kraft filed its own lawsuit in 2009, alleging that Sara Lee ran false and deceptive ads including a campaign in which Ball Parks are heralded as "America's Best Franks." The ad further asserts that other hot dogs "aren't even in the same league."
Another focus of the trial is Kraft's claim that its Oscar Mayer Jumbo Beef Franks are "100 percent pure beef." Sara Lee says the claim is untrue, cast aspersions on Ball Park franks and damaged their sales.
Kraft defends the "100 percent pure beef" tag, saying its intent was to state that the only meat used is beef. Some industry hot dogs include a mix of turkey, pork, chicken or other meats. Kraft further argues that the "pure beef" label is justified because surveys show a perception among some consumers that hot dogs contain "mystery meats."
Denlow interrupted Sara Lee's attorney several times in his opening statements.
"Don't we have here a couple of big hot dog companies just saying they are the best?" Denlow said at one point. "Is there something more unusual going on here than what goes on every day?"
Leighton responded that Kraft's alleged manipulation of the taste test and how it then based a massive advertising campaign on it in 2009 made the case unique.
At another point, Denlow said one could argue Sara Lee engaged in similar practices, including by basing its claims of being the No. 1 hot dog by citing in its ads an award given to Ball Park franks by ten leading chefs in San Francisco.
"And how would ten chefs in San Francisco know what the best hot dog is when they have never been to Chicago or tasted a Chicago hot dog?" Denlow said, cracking a smile.
The judge broached that subject again later, alluding to a rule among connoisseurs in the city never to put ketchup on a Chicago-style hot dog.
When Leighton suggested those participating in the Kraft hot dog tests should also have had the option of squirting ketchup on their dogs, Denlow interrupted, saying "That's an area of great debate."

Aug. 16--In a city that loves its hot dogs, the nation's top two wiener-makers battled in federal court Monday over dueling false advertising claims that have already underscored at least one frankfurter truism: Marketing sausage can be a lot like watching it being made.
Messy.
The trial stems from a 2009 lawsuit by Sara Lee Corp. over ads by Kraft Foods Inc. that claimed its hot dogs had won a national taste test and were "100 percent pure beef."
Kraft quickly filed its own countersuit, accusing Sara Lee of similar marketing no-nos, including boasting about its own "all beef" hot dog and misrepresenting a culinary award in touting its wieners as "America's best."
At stake in the legal battle is a $1.76 billion hot dog market dominated by Kraft's Oscar Mayer wieners and Sara Lee's Ball Park franks and whether either company's boasts crossed a line. The sales total doesn't include revenue from Wal-Mart and its club stores.
As the trial opened Monday in federal court in Chicago, lawyers for both Chicago-area food behemoths argued over such frank-marketing minutiae as the difference between meat and beef and whether a taste test could even be considered valid without such vital condiments as mustard.
Common ground seemed to lie only in puns, which proved irresistible to many in the courtroom.
Amid the heated hot dog talk, approximations became "ballpark" figures. An alleged disclosure was presented as a "frank" admission. And arguments naturally turned into "beefs."
"(I'm) trying to save one pun for the end of this," said Kraft attorney Stephen O'Neil, drawing a smile from U.S. Magistrate Judge Morton Denlow and chuckles from other lawyers.
But despite the occasional moments of levity, the openings statements by both sides brimmed with vitriol as only disputes between two fierce competitors can.
"Not in the entire history of American hot dogs" has a campaign of this scope been launched, Sara Lee attorney Richard Leighton said of Kraft's allegedly misleading advertising.
The filing of this lawsuit "was an act of utter hypocrisy," O'Neil volleyed back, alleging that Sara Lee's hot dogs had also been presented as "all beef" when they, too, contained other ingredients.
Although it's unusual for an advertising battle to result in a lawsuit, much less go to trial, the repercussions can be serious when a company is forced to revise or dismantle a marketing campaign that's already been aired in mass media or added to product packaging.
In 2004, Chicago provided the backdrop for an advertising debacle involving claims by Frito-Lay that Chicagoans preferred its potato chips to those of rival Jay's. The company was ultimately forced to cease the claims after a federal judge held that Lay's manipulated taste tests by labelings its chips as "classic" and Jays as "unflavored."
When companies go to court to resolve issues, it often comes down to raw emotion or desire for media attention, said Michael McSunas, an advertising lawyer with Chattanooga, Tenn.,-based Chambliss Bahner & Stophel.
"For whoever wins, it's not really going to affect sales," said McSunas, noting that most consumers were probably unaware of the short-lived hot dog ads. "(It) really speaks to how angry they are or how much publicity they want to get out of it."
Sara Lee's Ball Park has 22.5 percent of the national market, just ahead of Oscar Mayer's 20 percent, according to Chicago-based Symphony IRI, a market research firm.
The wiener war began after Northfield-based Kraft allegedly ran ads claiming "Oscar Mayer Jumbo Beef Franks beat Ball Park and Hebrew National in a national taste test."
Downers Grove-based Sara Lee said the ad and similar promotions that ran in magazines, stores and on the "Wienermobile" were misleading and based on an allegedly flawed taste test that didn't include condiment or bun choices, possibly affecting flavor.
Kraft denied the allegations and filed its own lawsuit against Sara Lee, alleging that the company was misusing an out-of-date ChefsBest award to promote its hot dogs as "America's best franks."
The 100-percent beef claim, Kraft contended, was never meant to imply there were no spices or preservatives used.
The advertising industry has long boasted of its ability to regulate itself. When competitors spar over claims, they usually appeal to the Federal Trade Commission's national advertising division. Parties agree to participate in the confidential process and abide by the decision. Generally, the body upholds an advertising claim, demands that a company make revisions or forces a company to withdraw the ad entirely.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also steps in occasionally to regulate health claims associated with food advertising. In 2009, the federal agency went after Cheerios for its claims that the oat cereal could, as part of a healthy diet, help reduce cholesterol.
"Before you put any claim out there, you need to make sure any claim that is made in an advertisement has been scrutinized internally and make sure it holds up," said Steve Gardner, president of Gardner Nelson Partners, a New York City-based advertising agency. Advertisers generally use market research to back up claims relating to consumer preference.
Part of the reason to be careful, Gardner said, is that "advertisers are vigilant to make sure they're aware of competitors' claims, what their claims are, the accuracy, often the stakes of those claims, and how they're interpreted by consumers."
So while it can become a legal issue, Gardner said that advertisers must also avoid overblown claims for fear of disappointing consumers who believe them.
Still, Tim Calkins, a clinical professor of marketing at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, wondered whether hot dog consumers would really be motivated by either Sara Lee and Kraft's claims when selling franks is usually about providing the lowest price.
"It's much more about the long-term competitive dynamic than the impact of one claim," he said.
Kraft has been closing the gap in recent years. In 2009, Kraft had 19.2 percent of the market to Sara Lee's 23.4 percent. Despite these commanding shares, the brands constitute a relatively small piece of Kraft, a $52.1 billion company, and even Sara Lee, an $8.7 billion company. Both Kraft and Sara Lee are in the process of splitting into smaller companies.
Judge Denlow, who will decide the case, indicated that he, at least, had apparently not been swayed by any of the advertising.
"I have already told you I have my own favorite hot dog," he said, "and it's none of the brands that are on trial."

New flight risk at DraftFCB

"[...] any staffing decisions we make will take into account the needs of our current clients and will reflect our determination to continue to keep our highest performers working on their businesses," the DraftFCB spokesman says.


FULL TEXT
---------

Freshly dumped by S. C. Johnson & Son Inc., ad agency DraftFCB Chicago is at risk of losing its biggest remaining consumer-sector client: MillerCoors LLC.
Executives of the Chicago-based brewer have told DraftFCB's leadership that they still are pleased with the shop's advertising and marketing work. But they've signaled they will take the business elsewhere if DraftFCB cuts or reassigns key personnel assigned to their brands in layoffs triggered by S. C. Johnson's departure, according to people close to the situation. An estimated 50 to 75 people work on Miller and Coors ads.
MillerCoors executives also are anxious about sticking with an agency that increasingly looks like a loser, these people say. The three-year contract
expires at yearend.
Racine, Wis.-based S. C. Johnson, DraftFCB's oldest and biggest client, reassigned its ad business to the Chicago offices of Ogilvy & Mather and EnergyBBDO in late July. The account generated at least $25 million in annual revenue in Chicago, with global billings topping $1 billion.
In addition, DraftFCB recently lost most of the big-budget TV work it had done for Northfield-based Kraft Foods Inc., previously its No. 2 account, and its TV duties for State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. of Bloomington; together, DraftFCB Chicago had derived more than $20 million in revenue a year from this work. The U.S. Postal Service account, in which DraftFCB is a small player, is under review, and the firm is ceding its Hampton Inn business as soon as a new agency is hired.
The flagship office has picked up several smaller accounts, including retail marketing for Coca-Cola Co. and Nestle S.A.'s Tombstone frozen pizza, but the gains don't offset its losses.
IT BEGINS
DraftFCB--the biggest Chicago-based agency by revenue--will start eliminating as many as 250 positions as soon as Monday, sources say. The purge will slash the company's 960-person Chicago staff by more than 25%.
The client defections are tainting DraftFCB's New York-based parent, Interpublic Group of Cos., as well. "IPG has once again become a 'show me' story, and that will likely require some time to play out and for investor confidence to improve," Alexia Quadrani, an advertising analyst at J. P. Morgan Chase & Co. in New York, wrote in a July 29 investor note.
The concerns underscore the stubborn culture clash between ad agency Foote Cone & Belding and direct marketing shop Draft Worldwide, which merged in 2006 under Interpublic.
Without S. C. Johnson and its roster of household products, which includes Raid, Glade, Windex and Saran Wrap, MillerCoors becomes DraftFCB's largest packaged-goods client, with annual revenue of $25 million to $30 million.
Other agencies already are making overtures to MillerCoors, including Chicago rivals DDB, Leo Burnett and Ogilvy & Mather. "We're always being approached by agencies, which isn't anything unique in the consumer-products industry," a MillerCoors spokesman says. Leo Burnett and Ogilvy & Mather decline to comment. DDB says the report is untrue.
Spokesmen for MillerCoors and DraftFCB also deny any recent, top-level discussions about the MillerCoors account, let alone threats by the client to decamp. "Naturally, any staffing decisions we make will take into account the needs of our current clients and will reflect our determination to continue to keep our highest performers working on their businesses," the DraftFCB spokesman says.
But in staff meetings, Martin Stock, the agency's director of account management and group account director in charge of the MillerCoors business, has told managers that the beer company "is watching us very carefully, and they want to make sure that staff is there that understand advertising and the consumer packaged-goods space," one of the people close to the situation says. Mr. Stock refers questions to the companies' spokesmen.
MillerCoors CEO Tom Long and Chief Marketing Officer Andy England also have warned agency leaders that an S. C. Johnson loss "should not touch our business," another insider says. "There's an implied 'or else,' " this person adds.
The big loss adds stress to a relationship under pressure. Mr. Long doesn't like having both of his biggest brands--Miller Lite and Coors Light--under the same agency, sources say. Sales trends don't help DraftFCB, either. While Coors Light's sales volume increased slightly in the second quarter, Miller Lite's volume sank by "mid-single digits" after falling 3.9% last year and 6.6% in 2009, according to the company.
"We know that Miller Lite has to be fixed, and we plan to fix it, but we need to make sure we have the right strategy in place before we can consider any agency changes," the MillerCoors spokesman says.

Once Kraft Foods Inc. splits in two, don't expect its U.S. grocery business to stick to a diet.
Even after the Northfield-based food titan breaks off global snacks from American packaged goods, the U.S. portion starts with plenty of heft: $16 billion in annual sales anchored by seven $1-billion-plus brands including Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, Oscar Mayer and Maxwell House. Though it will lose such big names as Oreo and Trident in the split, the U.S. company still will be the nation's biggest foodmaker.
But hobbled by a stagnant economy, persistent joblessness, rising ingredient costs and lower-priced store brands, the domestic Kraft will have to make acquisitions to boost revenue and satisfy shareholders. As well-known and popular as its megabrands are, many barely have been keeping pace, on a volume basis, with U.S. population growth.
"I don't think getting smaller is going to be an option for them," says Jin Hertel, managing partner of retail advisers Willard Bishop Consulting Ltd. in Barrington. The consolidation play would start to give Kraft the ability--or anybody else--to build some muscle to
be able to have a little bit more control and ability to take price increases."
Kraft likely will go shopping first in the meat and dairy aisles, where new products, such as yogurt and frozen breakfast meats, still can outperform the overall slow-growing food market, analysts say. Few, however, expect Kraft to bid for Sara Lee Corp.'s meat or coffee units. An offer for the Downers Grove-based rival's meats might cause antitrust problems, while Kraft once tried to exit the coffee sector.
"I don't see that being a good match at all," says Bob Goldin, managing director of Chicago-based food consultancy Technomic Inc.
An outright takeover of a competitor, such as Omaha, Neb.-based ConAgra Foods Inc., also seems improbable. Howard Bernstein, principal at J. H. Chapman Group LLC, a Rosemont-based food industry investment bank, says Kraft typically has been interested in $100-million brands. "They would be more interested in building it to a billion-dollar brand," he says.
Generally, analysts foresee Kraft boosting sales through three types of acquisitions: products that would flank those already in the company's portfolio; fast-rising categories that would take it in a new direction, and overlapping brands that would yield more economies of scale in purchasing and distribution.
For example, leveraging Kraft's macaroni brand, "who's to say they might not buy dried pasta ... smaller pasta companies that have been regional businesses?" Mr. Hertel says. With Greek-style yogurt a surprise hit with consumers, Kraft also might covet regional brands like Johnstown, N.Y.-based Fage USA Dairy Industry Inc.
Most observers agree that Kraft's U.S. business is too big and encumbered to be a target of private equity.
Before Kraft can bulk up, the company must deal with $23.4 million in long-term debt. Observers speculate that the company might push more of that liability onto the domestic business, but Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld told investors this month that "both businesses will be investment-grade." With the breakup not scheduled to take place until the end of 2012, it could be a year before Kraft spells out its debt-distribution plan.
Even as they expect Kraft to bulk up in the U.S., analysts predict it will unload some of its product lines, as it has since Ms. Rosenfeld took over in 2006. "I wouldn't be surprised if they looked at streamlining the portfolio," Mr. Goldin says.
BIG BRANDS
Kraft's North American grocery unit, which has revenue of $16.0 billion, includes the following $1-billion brands:
* Capri Sun
* Jell-O
* Kraft Macaroni & Cheese
* Maxwell House
* Miracle Whip
* Oscar Mayer
* Philadelphia Cream Cheese

Whether it's a food company helping women in Bangladesh create their own farm, a bank giving employees time to tutor poor city children online or an accounting firm donating employee skills at non-profits, a major theme for corporations' charitable projects over the past year has been to get people more engaged, not to just sign a check.
Kraft Foods Inc. launched a $3.8-million initiative this summer to help women in Indonesia and Bangladesh start farms. There, Kraft is working with New York-based Helen Keller International to fund 180 "centers of excellence" in farming. Thousands of women will learn sustainable farming practices and receive supplies to create homestead farms and give their families a nutritious diet. The program also provides nutrition education and small-business training to help the women sell their surplus crops.
Kraft also developed a company food garden at its Northfield headquarters campus this year. The 8,000-square-foot garden, built in collaboration with the Chicago Botanic Garden, is expected to produce roughly 14,000 pounds of food to be donated to local agencies, including soup kitchens and food pantries.
"Agriculture has long been viewed as a solution or a tool in the fight against hunger," says Nicole Robinson, Kraft's director of corporate community involvement. "We're just looking at new ways to solve old problems."
Kraft's work appears to mirror national trends. Instead of underwriting special events or fundraisers, companies are increasingly zeroing in on causes that most reflect their corporate missions, says Edith Falk, who chairs the Glenview-based Giving USA Foundation.
"They're looking for broader and deeper partnerships that go beyond cash," Ms. Falk says. "They're spending more and more time defining their goals and spending more time looking for partners to advance those goals."
Valerie Lies, president and CEO of the Chicago-based Donors Forum, sees an increasing number of firms donating professional services to non-profits rather than increasing their cash contributions and event sponsorships.
"Sometimes, they're donating work for a marketing project or maybe even helping with a process change. It's not just coming in one day and everybody painting a school," Ms. Lies says. The companies are trying to be creative about where they can put their resources where it really matters."
PRO BONO
Global accounting and advisory firm Deloitte LLP has been stepping up efforts to let employees donate time to charities and non-profits. Over the past three years, employees firmwide have completed nearly 300 projects valued at $50 million.
In the last several years, we've revised our approach to doing pro bono work," says Deborah DeHaas, Deloitte's Chicago-based Midwest regional managing partner. "We're treating it exactly like we would any client, in that we've formalized our processes and we enter into an engagement letter with the organization."
Ms. DeHaas says Deloitte is also deploying more dollars toward educational causes. A program launched by the company this year awarded a total of $450,000 in grants to organizations working on education reforms, such as improving high-school graduation rates and enhancing college readiness.
New York-based J. P. Morgan Chase & Co. also is focused on skills-based volunteering and finding creative ways to get more employees engaged. Joining with Innovations for Learning, an Evanston-based non-profit that develops technology to improve education, more than 450 of the bank's employees now tutor children over the Internet. Tutors are reaching local schools in Chicago, Detroit, Miami and New York.
Bank employees volunteer 30 minutes per week, working with the same child to improve reading skills. The children speak by phone while viewing their stories on computer screens.
"It's so effective, and it's so easy for them to participate," says Francee Harrington, who leads the bank's corporate responsibility work.

MIAMI, Aug. 15, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Club Med - the original all-inclusive resort company - is proud to announce today the appointment of Patrick Mitchell as Vice President of Sales for the North American Zone as part of a continued growth strategy for the brand. Following the events of 9/11, Club Med North America, along with the rest of the travel industry, suffered major financial consequences. It was a moment of reflection and Club Med made the decision to move forward with a major repositioning and multimillion dollar product investment that had been planned. The new focus on family upscale vacations proved to be successful with continued annual growth in profitability and customer satisfaction. Today, the brand is ready to reclaim its position as the leader in all-inclusive vacations.

(Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20110815/CL52367-b )
Such achievements have been recognized globally with the appointment of Xavier Mufraggi, CEO of Club Med North America, to the worldwide Board of Directors (Comite de Direction General). Mufraggi joined Club Med in 2005 after six years in Sales and Marketing for Kraft Foods in Europe. Xavier was quickly promoted to Vice President of Marketing for North America, and shortly afterwards to CEO of the Business Unit in 2008. His role on the CDG confirms the importance of the US market to the success of the global organization and the confidence in the new strategy to move from defensive to offensive mode.
Along with Mufraggi's recent appointment, Club Med strengthens the executive team with the addition of Patrick Mitchell as Vice President of Sales. With more than 15 years of experience in the hospitality industry, Patrick Mitchell has most recently held the position as Vice President of Global Sales Strategy and Planning at Norwegian Cruise Line. Previously, Mitchell held various positions at Royal Caribbean Cruise Line including Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Sales, Vice President of National Accounts, Associate Vice President of Field Sales and Associate Vice President of Marketing Services. Mitchell brings extensive expertise in strategic planning, development of sales planning methodologies and an impressive track record of growth of new sales distribution channels including a focus on developing the meeting and incentive market. Mitchell obtained his MBA from Yale University.
"I am extremely pleased to welcome this high-caliber executive to our team," Xavier Mufraggi, CEO of Club Med North America, said. "Mitchell will bring expertise in strategic planning, traditional and online travel agent networks and successful development of new distribution channels to our business unit. His skills fit well with our experienced management team and allow us to leverage the strength of our sales, marketing and internet teams to continue to grow our business."
Club Med's most notable achievement is the investment of 110+ million dollars in its North American Zone properties, which includes the successful re-launch of Club Med Sandpiper Bay in Port St. Lucie, FL.
Club Med Sandpiper Bay has exceeded expectations in Fiscal Year 2011 performance. In Winter 2011 the village delivered 47% more bookings and 65% more sales then it achieved in Winter 2010. The trend has continued through Summer 2011 as we see Sandpiper Bay generating 39% more bookings and 87% more sales on a year-to-date basis against Summer 2010. In addition to being the only all-inclusive family resort in the U.S., the 216-acre renovated Sandpiper Bay is the flagship of Club Med "premium sports" resorts. With the innovation of the Club Med Academies, Sandpiper Bay offers a new product with a world-class training environment in tennis, golf and fitness with coaching from renowned experts in the sports industry including Gabe Jaramillo, who trained the likes of Agassi and Seles; Brad Brewer, host of Golf Channel's Daily Brew; and professional tri-athlete and five-time Ironman Champion Heather Gollnick.

Corporations have complaints about credit rating agencies too

ABSTRACT
--------

A Lampert spokesman did not respond to an email or phone calls, but in the past the executive has insisted that the company deserves better credit ratings, which can lead to lower interest costs and, in the process, the financial wherewithal to expand, take other risks and create jobs.


FULL TEXT
---------

Aug. 14--Long before the Obama administration criticized Standard & Poor's for downgrading the nation's credit score, Edward Lampert was bashing credit rating agencies.
In February 2010, for example, the billionaire majority shareholder and chairman of Hoffman Estates-based Sears Holdings Corp. referred to the agencies' "simplistic analyses" that resulted in the retailer having a lower credit rating than rivals, even though he said it carried less debt than many of them.
"We do some things differently than others, and we have certain beliefs that differ from theirs," Lampert said in his February letter. He also complained about the credit rating agencies in February 2009, November 2007, March 2007, March 2006 and June 2005. That was the year Sears merged with Kmart.
On May 24, 2011, Sears' credit rating was downgraded to B+ from BB- as S&P cited weaker-than-expected earnings, falling sales and cost pressures.
"The rating on Sears Holdings Corp. reflects our expectations that sales will remain under pressure due to intense competition and weak consumer demand in the fragile economic recovery for high-ticket items such as appliances," S&P said. "Negative sales trends, combined with expected cost pressure, should result in lower-than-expected earnings in 2011."
Sears' revenue fell $341 million, to $9.7 billion, for the quarter ended April 30 from the same period a year ago. Sales at stores open at least a year dropped 3.6 percent.
A Lampert spokesman did not respond to an email or phone calls, but in the past the executive has insisted that the company deserves better credit ratings, which can lead to lower interest costs and, in the process, the financial wherewithal to expand, take other risks and create jobs.
Lampert's railings against ratings agencies remain open to debate, but they also can be seen in a new context in light of S&P's downgrade of the nation's debt rating from a stellar AAA to AA+. That move contributed to a sell-off in the stock market as investors worried whether the nation could be headed into a double-dip recession.
The Obama administration claims that S&P made a significant error in its calculations, and some in Congress are calling for greater scrutiny of the agency and its decision to take the nation's credit score down a notch. The ratings agencies also have been attacked for missing signs of the impending financial crisis that began in 2008.
A credit rating is an opinion about the ability of a debtor to meet its financial obligations. S&P's long-term debt ratings range from AAA to D, and ratings from AA to CCC may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign.
S&P also can assign ratings outlooks, including positive, negative or stable.
A Tribune review of S&P actions over the past year of credit ratings of 55 major Illinois companies shows that at least three have been downgraded and at least four upgraded. S&P also has, within the past year, assigned higher ratings outlooks to at least another nine businesses and lower ratings outlooks to at least four.
On Thursday, the credit rating for Chicago-based wallboard manufacturer USG Corp. was lowered to B from B+ by S&P on expectations of a persistent slump in new-home construction.
A USG spokesman said the downgrade should have no immediate impact on the company because it's not planning to borrow in the near term. At the end of the second quarter, USG had liquidity of more than $900 million, including more than $700 million in cash, a spokesman said.
Downgrades in credit ratings also can tarnish a company's image, which is especially important to financial services concerns.
Just ask Manulife Financial Corp., the Toronto-based owner of the Boston-based John Hancock family of mutual funds.
"The ratings are very important to us, not just in terms of how we financially manage the company but how we protect the brand in the marketplace," Michael Bell, Manulife's chief financial officer, said in November during an investor day.
The company's brands "connote financial strength to people, and therefore it's very important for us to have strong financial strength ratings from S&P and Moody's, as well as the others," Bell said. "So we have ongoing dialogue" with the credit rating agencies.
He said in November that Manulife had a strong case for maintaining its rating. But, a month later, S&P cut its credit rating to A- from A.
In February, Manulife told analysts that it continued to have discussions with the rating agencies.
"We really don't know when they'll get it," Manulife Chief Executive Donald Guloien said, alluding to how the agencies haven't yet caught on to favorable financial trends that the company was experiencing. "Give it six months or a year and maybe the ratings agencies start to notice that Manulife is substantially de-risked from where it was before."
So what's S&P's take on some of Illinois' largest companies?
CME Group Inc., the Chicago-based exchange, has an AA rating, one of a handful of Illinois publicly traded companies with such a high credit score from S&P.
In June, however, S&P gave CME a "negative" outlook, meaning that there's a one-third chance it could lower its rating in the next six to 24 months. S&P cites increasing competition, among other things, for CME's negative outlook.
Nicor Inc. also enjoys an AA rating. But in December, S&P trimmed its outlook from "stable" to "CreditWatch negative." The Naperville-based utility is being acquired by AGL Resources Inc., which S&P also placed on "CreditWatch negative" after it announced its deal for Nicor.
After Standard & Poor's announcement, Fitch affirmed Nicor and Nicor Gas' ratings and outlook and AGL Resources' ratings. Moody's affirmed Nicor, Nicor Gas' and AGL Resources' ratings, but changed Nicor Gas' outlook to negative from stable, Nicor said.
Abbott Laboratories, which also has an AA credit rating from S&P, was identified last week by S&P's stock analysts as one of 20 high-quality equities.
A few Chicago-area companies have received improved credit outlooks, according to S&P.
Tenneco Inc., an automotive supplier, in May got upgraded to BB from BB- as S&P was heartened by the automotive industry's recovery and by the Lake Forest-based company's cost-cutting efforts.
Brunswick Corp., a recreational products manufacturer, saw its S&P credit rating boosted two notches in April, to B+ from B-, due partly to a lower-cost manufacturing structure at the Lake Forest-based company.
Brunswick said it was also upgraded recently by Moody's, another ratings agency.
"These actions have had minimal financial impact upon the company in the near term, but are an important step toward Brunswick's goal to regain our investment-grade rating," a company spokesman said. S&P considers anything in the BBB class and above investment grade.
LKQ Corp., a Chicago-based auto-parts supplier, in May saw its credit rating boosted to BB+ from BB, with S&P citing such factors as consistent profitability.
Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc. of Chicago in July was upgraded by S&P to BB+ from BB, citing lower debt.
Companies that have received upgraded outlooks within the past year from S&P include Mead Johnson Nutrition Co., Ventas Inc., Allstate Corp., CF Industries Holdings Inc., Integrys Energy Group Inc., First Industrial Realty Trust Inc., Titan International Inc., General Growth Properties Inc. and Unitrin Inc.
Other Chicago-area companies that have seen recent changes in their S&P profiles include:
-- R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co. Its debt last spring was cut to junk status, to BB+, the highest speculative grade issued by S&P.
-- Kraft Foods Inc. The food company's outlook earlier this month was trimmed to "stable" from "positive," though S&P affirmed its debt rating at BBB. S&P cited, among other things, Kraft's higher debt levels compared with other BBB companies. The Northfield-based business is splitting itself into two companies next year.
On Aug. 4, Kraft Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld said both companies will be investment grade, with access to commercial paper markets.
-- Fortune Brands Inc. In December, S&P said that it was putting the consumer company's BBB- credit rating on "CreditWatch with negative implications," meaning that it could lower or affirm the ratings after a review. S&P said it was trying to sort out what Fortune's efforts to split the company will mean for its debt investors.
A spokesman for the Deerfield-based company said last week that S&P's rating is "no longer relevant."
"We're focused on the balance sheets of our two businesses that are on track to become independent companies early in the fourth quarter," a Fortune spokesman said. "With the benefit of the $1.2 billion sale of our golf business, our current bond tender to reduce debt and strong cash flow, we're confident" that the spirits and home businesses "will go independent with strong capital structures."
For Sears, the advantage of having a higher credit rating isn't nearly as great as it is for other companies because it has had less of a need to tap the bond market, said Carol Levenson, research director for Gimme Credit LLC.
"The reasons are that it no longer had a credit operation and that its expansion has slowed to a near halt," she said. "Until late last year it had nearly no bonds outstanding."
Late last year, Sears issued a private placement of secured debt. It was its first new bond issue since 2003, according to Bloomberg, Levenson said.
"As the company's need to issue debt is not all that great given its current business model, management probably believes that it's more important to buy back stock and support the stock price than to save money on interest expense by working to get upgraded," Levenson said. "Macy's is a perfect example of a retailer that believed the opposite, and stopped buying back stock until it had improved its debt protection measures to investment grade levels."

Whether the familiar piano classic, United's ubiquitous soundtrack for the past two decades, survives the transition remains to be heard. "Since we haven't yet developed the new campaign, we don't yet know whether 'Rhapsody' will play a part," said Rahsaan Johnson, a United spokesman.

Aug. 12--United Airlines' 'tulip' tail feather may be gone, but what about its "Rhapsody in Blue" commercial theme song?
Chicago-based United Continental Holdings, which redesigned its logo and repainted its planes in the wake of last year's merger agreement between United and Continental Airlines, is moving its $70 million to $100 million advertising account to New York-based agency McGarryBowen. Whether the familiar piano classic, United's ubiquitous soundtrack for the past two decades, survives the transition remains to be heard.
"Since we haven't yet developed the new campaign, we don't yet know whether 'Rhapsody' will play a part," said Rahsaan Johnson, a United spokesman. "We are now beginning to develop a campaign that we expect we will launch in 2012."
Struggling to mesh everything, from frequent-flier bonus miles to the boarding regimen, without alienating the core customers of each airline, the advertising shift is the latest change since the merger created the world's largest carrier in October 2010.
United Airlines has worked with Minneapolis-based ad agency Barrie D'Rozario Murphy for the past seven years, while Continental has used New York-based Kaplan Thaler Group since 1998. With different agencies handling both airlines, the company initiated a review this year through New York-based Bajkowski & Partners, looking for a fresh start, according to executives.
"In integrating United and Continental, we reviewed existing vendor agreements throughout the two airlines' functional areas, including our ad agency relationships," Johnson said.
Initially, eight agencies were in the running, including the incumbents, but BDM removed itself from consideration, while KTG was eliminated in the first round, according to executives. The final pitches came down to three agencies: Boston-based Arnold Worldwide, the Los Angeles office of TBWA\Chiat\Day and McGarryBowen, with the latter getting the nod Wednesday.
"Selecting a new long-term agency partner with the depth, expertise and passion to help us advance the United brand is one of the most important marketing decisions we have made since closing the merger of United and Continental," Mark Bergsrud, senior vice president of marketing at the airline, said in a statement.
United is just the latest Chicago business snared by McGarryBowen, which opened a Chicago office in 2006. The agency has about 200 employees here working on Northfield-based Kraft Foods, Hoffman Estates-based Sears and several other major clients. The United account will be handled out of New York, with no new hires expected locally, according to an agency source.
The new marketing strategy is under wraps until the spring. In the meantime, United is running an interim campaign created by KTG, which combines the look of previous Continental commercials, with the familiar sounds of "Rhapsody in Blue," George Gershwin's 1924 piano piece, which the airline secured the rights to in 1976. Used in radio and televisions spots since the mid-1980s, KTG is the fourth successive United advertising agency to employ the music, said Johnson.
With the Continental globe replacing the United tulip on plane tails -- the entire fleet was repainted this year -- speculation is rampant that the United theme song, which is heard everywhere from the O'Hare terminal to in-flight welcome videos, may eventually be history as well.
For some observers, paint schemes and music should be the least of the behemoth carrier's concerns as it attempts to merge two corporate cultures and placate the fliers loyal to each airline.
People worry, but they don't worry about whether it's Continental blue, United blue or "Rhapsody in Blue," said Joe Brancatelli, a New York-based air travel writer.
"The leisure traveler is focused on the price, the business traveler is worried about the quality of the airline, and the real frequent flier -- we're all waiting on details on what the new MileagePlus may be," he said.
While Brancatelli said "travelers are resistant to change," he cited the airline's recent waffling between Continental's and United's boarding system as the kind of thing that irks longtime passengers.
"In the last few months we've seen the fight over the boarding regimen. They tried to switch to Continental's regimen, and the United people were up in arms, so they switched back," he said.
Other problems, said Brancatelli, include different configurations on some of United's international flights, where entire passenger classes disappear, and desired perks like Continental's flat-bed seats show up at random.
For Brancatelli, who flew Continental far more frequently premerger, the possibility that United may find a new theme song is one change he would welcome.
"I don't want my Gershwin to be Muzak," he said. "I'm not a big fan of hearing it a billion times as I walk through O'Hare."

enVista, a leading enterprise, transportation and supply chain consulting services firm recently helped a leading private equity firm with over $9 billion in invested capital and its portfolio companies strategically source ocean container contracts to reduce annual ocean carrier costs by twice the industry average and significantly improve carrier service.
The project made extensive use of GT Nexus's Procurement and Optimization modules and Bid Analysis reporting to consolidate sourcing. The project also included the development of a single ocean contract identifying the equity firm's portfolio companies as affiliates, as well as the appropriate governance model structure to manage contract amendments, minimum quantity commitments (MQCs), and weekly capacity allocations in the context of consolidated sourcing.
The sourcing process included three rounds of bidding, one round of face-to-face meetings and one-on-one final negotiation of terms and completion of contracts. As a result, the project reduced the private equity firm's carrier base by 20 percent and improved the quality of carriers based on factors, including: sailing frequency, transit time, capacity, and invoice data quality.

Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/75ce62/belarus_food_and_d) has announced the addition of the "Belarus Food and Drink Report Q3 2011" report to their offering.
The Belarus Food and Drink Report provides industry professionals and strategists, corporate analysts, food and drink associations, government departments and regulatory bodies with independent forecasts and competitive intelligence on Belarus's food and drink industry.
While strong industrial activity and exports will keep economic growth well supported, household consumption in Belarus will be constrained, as the government attempts to rein in a massive current account deficit. In fact, consumers in Belarus have traditionally been fond of economy items, a pattern further solidified by the elevated unemployment levels and inflation tipping into double-digit figures.
At the same time, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's previous pledge to bring average monthly wages up to US$500 now looks unachievable, at least in the near term, while further local currency devaluation will make imported food and drink products even more expensive.
Headline Industry Data (local currency):
-- 2011 food consumption = +10.96%; forecast to 2015 = +74.79%
-- 2011 per capita food consumption = +11.45%; forecast to 2015 = +78.51%
-- 2011 alcoholic drinks sales = +9.82%; forecast to 2015 = +69.37%
-- 2011 per capita alcoholic drinks sales = +10.30%; forecast to 2015 = +72.98%
Companies Mentioned:
-- Bellakt
-- Kraft Foods
-- Krinitsa
-- PepsiCo
-- Mass Grocery Retail
-- Sedmoi Kontinent
-- Vester

TUCSON, Ariz., Aug. 10, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- The National Coalition of Associations of 7-Eleven Franchisees announced today that it has helped to raise nearly three quarters of a million dollars this year for two of its charitable partners, Hire Heroes USA and the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA). Hire Heroes is a non-profit organization offering transition assistance, job search assistance and job placement services to those veterans injured or disabled in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, and MDA is a nonprofit health agency dedicated to curing muscular dystrophy, ALS and related diseases.
During its most successful convention in its 36-year history last month in Las Vegas, the National Coalition presented Hire Heroes leadership with a check for $310,000 to support the organization's transition assistance workshops run at military installations. In concert with 7-Eleven, Inc., and nine vendor partners, the National Coalition and its 36 Franchise Owners' Associations raised funds through sales of specific products offered by brand-name companies which donated a portion of each sale for the program. Participating companies included Nestle USA, Anheuser-Busch InBev, MillerCoors, E. & J. Gallo Winery, Dr Pepper-Snapple Group, Tropicana Products, Inc., Mars, Inc., Kellogg's and Kraft Foods, Inc. Fees from the Coalition's annual Joe Saraceno Memorial Golf Tournament, and donations made from the public, also contributed to the total. This donation was the second in a three-year commitment to Hire Heroes, and the largest single-year contribution made to Hire Heroes by the Coalition.
The National Coalition also presented MDA with a check for $420,000, representing funds raised through a national store-based canister program supported by 7-Eleven, Inc, as well as live and silent auctions at the Coalition's annual convention. The contribution is a manifestation of a long-term partnership between the MDA, the Coalition, its Franchise Owners' Associations, individual franchisees and 7-Eleven, Inc.
"Our ability to give back to these important programs is something that makes each and every member of our 7-Eleven franchisee family very proud," stated Bruce Maples, chairman of the National Coalition. "Committing ourselves to supporting both our military veterans and those individuals and families who have been touched by neuromuscular disease represents the great American tradition of generosity that our owners, their employees, our vendors and our customers are known for."
The Coalition's 36th annual national convention in Las Vegas brought in record numbers of franchise owners and exhibitors. In addition to the trade show for exhibitors, the convention featured a range of speakers including Super Bowl XII Champion Drew Pearson of the Dallas Cowboys. Actor Max Adler, star of the hit television series Glee, was also on hand to sign autographs and support the work of MDA and 12-year-old Abbey Umali, MDA's 2011 National Goodwill Ambassador. Preparations are now underway for the 37th annual convention which will be held next July in Honolulu, Hawaii.
The National Coalition of Associations of 7-Eleven Franchisees is the national trade group for 7-Eleven storeowners in the U.S., representing the interests of 4,900 franchise-owned stores, and their membership organizations, which employ nearly 40,000 workers.

Insider buying and selling is valuable screening criteria to help retail investors determine which stocks to track.

Dr. Langston gained national and international recognition in the 1980s for the discovery of the link between a tainted "synthetic heroin" and parkinsonism, which contained a substance known as MTPT, which is selectively toxic to the same nerve cells in the brain that die in Parkinson's disease.

KINGSTON, N.J., Aug. 9, 2011 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Parkinson's Unity Walk is pleased to announce two new members to its Board of Directors, each bringing their own expertise - Dr. J. William Langston and James J. McNasby.
Dr. J. William Langston is the Scientific Director, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of the Parkinson's Institute in Sunnyvale, CA. A graduate of the University of Missouri School of Medicine, he served as faculty member at Stanford University Medical School and Chairman of Neurology at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose, CA, before founding The Parkinson's Institute.
Dr. Langston gained national and international recognition in the 1980s for the discovery of the link between a tainted "synthetic heroin" and parkinsonism, which contained a substance known as MTPT, which is selectively toxic to the same nerve cells in the brain that die in Parkinson's disease. The discovery of the biologic effects of this compound led to a renaissance of the basic and clinical research in Parkinson's disease. Dr. Langston's current research interests include the study of mechanisms of neuronal degeneration, the etiology of Parkinson's disease, the development of new strategies to slow or halt disease progression, and ways to identify the disease in its earliest "pre-motor" stages. He is the founding member and continues to serve on the Scientific Advisory Board for the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research.
Jim McNasby has been General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer for Marsh, Inc. -- Marsh & McLennan Companies insurance brokerage and risk advisory subsidiary -- since 2007. Before joining Marsh, Mr. McNasby was the Chief Counsel for Kraft Foods North American business and, prior to that, held various positions in the Legal, Compliance and Corporate & Government Affairs departments of the Kraft/Altria Group in the U.S. and in Europe. He began practicing law at Davis Polk & Wardwell and is a graduate of the University of Virginia and Harvard Law School.
Mr. McNasby was diagnosed with Early Onset Parkinson's disease in 2000 at the age of 31. He has been a participant in the Parkinson's Unity Walk since 2007 as Team Captain of Team McMoss. Team McMoss is the Walk's highest fundraising team for the second year in a row.
The Parkinson's Unity Walk, held each April in New York's Central Park, is the largest grassroots fundraiser for Parkinson's disease research in the country. Over the last seventeen years, the Walk has grown from 200 participants raising $16,000 to more than 10,000 participants, raising $1.5M this year and more than $14M since it was first held in 1994. One hundred percent of individual donations go directly to Parkinson's research, benefiting seven major U.S. Parkinson's foundations.
More information about the Parkinson's Unity Walk is available at www.unitywalk.org.

With Irene Rosenfeld's plan to hew Kraft Foods Inc. into two companies, America's biggest food-maker raised the white flag on the country's consumers.
The chairman-CEO signaled that the Northfield-based company's all-American brands have stalled and can no longer depend on the families that made Kraft Macaroni & Cheese and Jell-O pantry staples to buy them at a pace and price that will satisfy shareholders. Instead, Kraft will create a new snack-driven company that will rely on customers in places like India and Brazil to buy Cadbury chocolates and Oreo cookies. It will then manage the cash-focused grocery company for margins and shareholder dividends.
Kraft "is taking action before it ever has to potentially disappoint investors in a struggle to reach likely overly optimistic sales growth targets," wrote Andrew Lazar, New York-based U.S. food analyst at Barclays Capital Plc.
In walling off its U.S. business, the nation's most powerful food company has admitted that it can't pull off
the kind of innovation needed to blunt the ongoing revenue drain from high commodity costs and price competition. In effect, just like Sara Lee Corp. did earlier this year when it announced plans to split into a global coffee company and a domestic meat company, Kraft is giving up on America.
"I don't think they're consciously making that choice, but I can imagine it happening by people being focused on the short-term gain," says Ron Burt, professor of sociology and strategy at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. He says that when companies break up to put the out-of-date pieces somewhere else, "it's not that they're going overseas, it's just we don't want them on our budget."
'RUBBISH'
Kraft rejects any talk of abandonment. "I can't speak for other companies, but Kraft Foods is deeply committed to the American market," a Kraft spokesman says. "Any suggestion to the contrary is rubbish."
Ms. Rosenfeld had few choices. Many of the company's longtime brands have grown stale with U.S. consumers. At the same time, major investors, including activist shareholder Nelson Peitz, were stirring. Sales volume for grocery brands like Kraft salad dressings fell 3.3% in 2010 as prices rose, while snacks like Oreo cookies saw a 0.5% increase on slightly lower prices.
"Our economy, although growing, isn't growing at a fast enough pace for (Kraft) to adhere to its shareholder responsibilities. At the end of the day, these are public companies," says Mickey Klein, managing director and partner of global investment bank Astor Group LLC, based in New York.
Kraft's major brands, such as Oscar Mayer, Maxwell House, Kraft cheese and Philadelphia Cream Cheese and grocery items like Miracle Whip, Jell-O and Kraft dressings, "have lost between half a share point to a share point a year for the past five to 10 and 15 years," said Burt P. Flickinger III, managing director of New York-based consumer industry consultant Strategic Resource Group Inc.
In addition, product innovation waned while the company focused on acquisitions. Kraft launched Mio water enhancer earlier this year, but "it's too early to tell," Mr. Flickinger says. But it's not the next Capri Sun. There really has been very little innovation other than the highly successful reformulation and reintroduction of the broader portfolio across the Triscuit brand,"
rolled out in 2004.
Analysts expect the $16-billion grocery company, with brands such as Oscar Mayer, Miracle Whip and Kool-Aid, to generate sales growth between 2% and 4% annually and earnings-per-share growth between 6% and 8%.
Food analyst Christopher Growe of Baltimore, Md.-based Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. speculated that Ms. Rosenfeld would most likely run the new $32-billion global snack company while Tony Vernon, now president of Kraft's North America unit, is the front-runner to lead the grocery company.
Kraft and Sara Lee aren't alone in looking beyond their U.S. borders for new customers, but they are among the first to spin off the slower-growing businesses in exchange for global growth. Other companies, such as Minneapolis-based General Mills Inc. and Seattle-based Starbucks Corp., are depending more heavily on overseas markets for growth. They, too, could follow Kraft and Sara Lee in breaking up for shareholders.
In fact, Indra Nooyi, chairman-CEO of Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo Inc., recently mused to Barclays Capital about Frito-Lay as a standalone company, sparking investor chatter.
The Kraft move is "sure to touch many other companies across the broader (consumer packaged goods) space," Mr. Lazar says. "We see this event as almost like a starting gun going off from an M&A perspective, or in terms of shifting the pieces around in the space."
While analysts anticipate that Kraft's move could spur more breakups, it doesn't necessarily portend a new round of mass consolidation.
"The U.S. food industry is still pretty consolidated. This transaction doesn't change that that much," says Greg Pearlman, Chicago-based managing director of BMO Capital Markets' food, consumer and retail group. "People are being paid to specialize, so now Kraft is a specialized U.S. food company and specialized global snacking business. Sara Lee is a specialized meat business and specialized coffee business."
CHERRY-PICKING
Kraft management and investors have rationalized the breakup as a way for shareholders to cherry-pick how they want to invest, whether for higher returns or more reliable dividends. But that doesn't fix Kraft's inherent problem of dwindling year-over-year volume on brands that have become default consumer choices without true innovation to draw new customers.
"A lot of those brands have hit a speed bump," says Robert Passikoff, president of New York-based brand consultant Brand Keys Inc. "It says that the marketplace is not bottomless and that eventually the brands that can stand for something in the minds of the consumer and can occupy larger and larger spaces on the grocery shelves are going to be the ones that are the last standing."
But that's happening less in the food business, where there hasn't been significant innovation since the organic boom in the middle of the last decade, according to Ken Harris, CEO of Evanston-based retail consultant Kantar Retail Americas Consulting.
Before that there was the protein-based Atkins diet, and before that fat-free and low-fat trends to drive sales. "There has been a dearth of truly profound innovation in food," he says. "There are pockets of food segments that are exciting, but they are not big enough to move the needle at this point."

ABSTRACT
--------

According to SEC records, the Smirnoff and Johnnie Walker maker made more than $1.7 million in illicit payments to Indian government officials from 2003 to 2009. According to government records, the annual turnover of the CSD amounted to Rs 6,955 crore in 2008-09.

It is a shot that London-based liquor giant Diageo Plc would rather gulp and forget in a hurry. Last fortnight, the world's largest spirit maker agreed to pay up more than $16 million to settle charges levelled by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC - the Securities and Exchange Board of India equivalent in the US).
The charges included making "hundreds of illicit payments to foreign government officials" in India, Thailand and South Korea. "As a result of Diageo's lax oversight and deficient controls, the subsidiaries routinely used third parties, inflated invoices, and other deceptive devices to disguise the true nature of the payments," said Scott W Friestad, associate director of the SEC's division of enforcement, in a statement.
According to SEC records, the Smirnoff and Johnnie Walker maker made more than $1.7 million in illicit payments to Indian government officials from 2003 to 2009. These officials were "responsible for purchasing or authorising the sale of its beverages in India" and as a result of these payments, the increased sales resulted in $11 million in profit for the company.
Interestingly, during this period, Diageo is also accused of reimbursing "improper payments" to the tune of $530,955 made by third party sales promoters to government employees of the Indian military's Canteen Stores Department (CSD). The payments were made to "foster the promotion of Diageo products", "secure the release of seized shipments of Diageo products" and "promote good will (sic) through the distribution of Diwali and New Year's holiday gifts" to CSD employees.
Also, this is not the first time that an accusing finger has been pointed at the CSD. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India had said in a 2009 report that the CSD's procurement and distribution of dry rations were faulty. According to government records, the annual turnover of the CSD amounted to Rs 6,955 crore in 2008-09.
For its part, Diageo says the SEC "has not found any evidence of senior management direction of the activities" or that "the issues were endemic in Diageo". "We have taken appropriate disciplinary action against personnel who were involved in the practices referenced in the SEC order including, in some instances, dismissal from our business," replied a London-based spokesperson to a written query sent by ET on Sunday.
The Diageo case, however, has pointers towards the endemic corruption in government, and how MNCs administered by a tougher anti-graft regime overseas are walking the proverbial tightrope in India.
Uncle Sam's Sticky Fingers
There are enough examples of MNCs, especially American companies, that have admitted bribing Indian government officials to their regulators and law enforcement agencies - be it the US Department of Justice (DoJ) or the SEC (see Uncle Sam's Greasy Pies). Take American photocopy giant Xerox, for instance. Back in 2002, Xerox, then in the midst of an accounting scandal, declared that its Indian subsidiary Xerox ModiCorp (a joint venture with BK Modi's ModiCorp) had paid $700,000 bribes to its Indian government customers for the supply of equipment.
Earlier this year, Kraft Foods revealed that it was being investigated by the SEC which had asked for information about "dealings with Indian governmental agencies and officials to obtain approvals related to the operation" of a facility it inherited with the Cadbury acquisition in India.
In May 2009, Meera Shankar, then India's ambassador to the US, shot off a letter to TKA Nair, the Prime Minister's principal secretary citing cases of Indian government officials being bribed by US-based companies. The talking point was an agreement signed by Pennsylvania-based company, Wabtec with the US DoJ to cough up a $300,000 penalty. The company was found guilty of using its Kolkata-based subsidiary to bribe officials from Indian Railway Board and Maharashtra State Electricity Corporation. The prime minister's office referred it to the department of personnel and training (DoPT), and the matter finally landed with the CBI.
"These admissions of guilt [by these companies] are not all altruistic or confessions of a prickly conscience," says a leading Delhi-based corporate lawyer, whose firm represents half a dozen MNCs in India. "The American companies are cutting a deal. When companies self-report their underhand payments to foreign officials, they can wrangle out a settlement with their regulators. Typically, the penalties come down by a third or a fourth when companies self-report," he adds. Not long ago, bribes paid out were tax deductible in Germany, says Peter Goldsmith - a partner with Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, an international law firm - only partly in jest.
The Vanishing Agents Having said that, anti-graft laws across the world are getting tougher and the penalties steeper. Enforcement agencies globally are talking more and more with each other, adds Goldsmith. And this is perhaps why MNCs are shunning some age-old graft practices, like engaging agents on a commission basis to bag government contracts, says an Indian official working for the vigilance section of an economy ministry.
Typically, an agent is not paid a retainer fee, but gets a cut of 5-10% of a contract's worth. The agent usually uses his own resources to bribe government officials, with the hope that winning the bid translates to a huge windfall, mostly in cash. For accounting purposes, the company would show the entire transaction as a fee to a consultancy.
A classic example is the case of York International which secured contracts on airconditioning, ventilation and refrigeration equipment in Iraq under the United Nations oil-for-food programme between 2000 and 2003. The company, through its subsidiaries, bribed officials in countries like India, Turkey and China. It devised elaborate schemes to conceal kickback payments as consultancy payments. But investigators later found that no bona fide services were performed, and a total of 854 improper consultancy payments were recorded.
Two other vigilance officers of government departments have confirmed to ET on Sunday that MNC agents who used to play key roles in big-ticket contracts in sectors like defence, railways, power are no longer so active. "Strict accounting practices in the US and EU are making the difference," says one of the officers.
VK Agarwal, former chief of vigilance of Indian Railways does not however buy the theory that corrupt practices by MNCs have come down. "They don't approach anyone and everyone. They do check the background of an official before indulging in bribery," says Agarwal who later became the chairman of the Railway Board.
Mangoes and IPL
Across the globe, bribe money has several aliases. In Germany, bribes are known as schmiergeld (grease money). "The code word for a bribe in Germany is 'spare parts'. Bribes are also known as mangoes, slides and books and magazines," says Goldsmith.
As the secret lexicon for graft has grown, so have the ways in which bribes are paid. According to Agarwal, the standard practice is handing out cash and depositing it in pre-decided bank accounts. Also, many MNCs (and Indian companies) rope in key officers when they go on a foreign junket.
"One hears stories about an Indian company which flew a judge and his family for the IPL tournament in South Africa," says a Mumbai-based industry watcher. "A bribe is not just cash stuffed in an envelope. People are known to ask for admission in a top college for their children or a vacation," says a senior corporate manager. Some of the MNCs are admitting to paying bribes to Indian officials, what is the government doing to following up on these cases? The answers are difficult to come by.
According to government sources ET on Sunday spoke to, Indian agencies like the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) and CBI have used leads from high profile cases of US and European companies being penalised by their respective governments for bribing Indian officials. But how many of these 'leads' have translated to actual prosecutions and punishments is unclear.
The agencies have their own challenges. "Some of these settlements have confidentiality clauses," says Ramesh Vaidyanathan, partner, Advaya Legal. "Moreover, what's proof enough under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act [the US law that prevents American companies from bribing foreign officials] may not be sufficient for prosecution under Indian criminal laws," adds Vaidyanathan.
And then, there is the infamous lethargy of the Indian agencies. In November 2010, the SEC charged Pride International, one of the world's largest drilling companies, of using a subsidiary Pride Forasol to bribe a judge of the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal (CEGAT) to obtain a favourable order in 2003. Finally, in March 2011, after Pride became a public case study at Interpol's Paris conference, Indian authorities began investigations.
To be fair, Indian agencies like the anti-corruption watchdog, CVC, receives over 5,000 cases of alleged corruption per year. Based on CVC's advice during 2009, for which data is available, various government departments issued sanction for prosecution against 225 officers, imposed major penalties on 876 and minor penalties on 947 others.
The Tightrope
MNCs meanwhile face their own set of problems. One the one hand, they have a set of anti-graft laws, like the UK Bribery Act which came into force this July, that are getting stricter. "Under the UK Bribery Act, a company can be prosecuted even if an 'associated person' bribes a foreign official," says Goldsmith. "An associated person could be a third party like the employee of a PR agency, an employee of a joint venture etc," he adds. The act also enlarges the definition of a bribe to include hospitality related expenses. "We get inquiries from clients if it is okay for them to give out or accept hospitality passes for the Wimbledon championships," adds Goldsmith.
At the same time, in countries like India, it is almost the norm for companies to give gifts to government employees on festive occasions such as Diwali. A consultant familiar with the Diageo matter said that most of the payments made to officials were just 'routine incentives' paid to Delhi Corporation's stores' employees to increase visibility of the company's products. "How else could have the SEC got details about the hundreds of payments the company made to them? They were not bribes," says the official.
At the same time, given the corrupt procurement practices in government departments, MNCs which don't pay bribes are seriously disadvantaged. "Indian companies are governed by a different set of laws. When it comes to public procurement, Indian companies (those that pay bribes) have a business advantage over their MNC counterparts, as the lack of Indian legislation that covers the grey areas like gifting and third party payments helps their cause," says the legal counsel for a leading corporate.
It's an advantage that won't last long, say legal eagles. India ratified the UN convention against corruption in May this year and is likely to sign the OECD convention sometime sooner than later. Moreover, as Indian companies go global, laws like the UK Bribery Act are likely to affect them. For example, an Indian company which pays a bribe in Africa could be prosecuted in the UK, provided it is listed in the UK or even has a subsidiary in the country. "With Indian companies going global, and considering the stringent requirements of UK Bribery Act, these companies would need to monitor the activities of their partners and agents to mitigate the risk of non-compliance with the law," says Neeta Potnis, senior director, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India.
Other than signing these conventions, what else can India do to tackle the menace of graft? "Look at the FMCG sector," says Adi Godrej, president-designate, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), and chairman of CII's task force on transparency and integrity in governance. "There is hardly any corruption in the sector because one does not have to constantly go to the government to seek permissions there. Lesser the government control, lower the levels of corruption. I think one way of tackling corruption is by simplifying government procedures and making the process of approvals more transparent."

PALO ALTO, Calif., Aug. 8, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- shopkick, the largest location-based shopping app that rewards shoppers simply for walking into stores, today announced great momentum in its work with consumer brands, crediting its unique 'real world click' advertising model as the source of its success. In just three months, 12 new large branded product manufacturers have joined shopkick's Partner Alliance: CoverGirl, Disney, General Mills, Levi's, Libman, Mead Johnson, Meguiar's, Mr. Clean, Olay, Revlon, Tilex and Trident. In addition to the new brand partners, shopkick users have scanned products from existing brand partners - Kraft Foods, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, HP and Intel - more than 6.5 million times, at 250,000 stores nationwide.
With shopkick, brand interactions happen right in the store, and they go well beyond scanning and rewards. Shopkick delivers rewards for numerous types of measurable ways shoppers discover and connect with new and familiar brands and products. People can view recipes, watch videos, answer questions, go on scan missions and more, prompting frequent exposure to partner brand products that spans the buying cycle - and resulting in great insight for brand partners on what drives customer engagement and decisions.
"Shopkick really gets how important it is for consumers to touch, see and feel the product and the role it plays in driving sales," said Ed Kaczmarek, Director of Innovation, New Services at Kraft Foods. "Through shopkick we can guide shoppers to our products on the store shelves, even across multiple aisles, and then reward them for checking them out,"
The most popular category of scanned items is Electronics, closely followed by Food and Beverage. These interactions are taking place at all types of stores - from national retailers to the corner store. Four of shopkick's current retail partners - Best Buy, Target, American Eagle and Macy's - are on the list of the Top 10 stores where the most product scans take place.
"Shopping and the ability to influence the path to purchase are being redefined by mobile and shopkick is leading the way. For the first time, a brand has the opportunity to have a dialogue and direct a conversation with shoppers that starts outside the store, continues into the store, at the aisle and ultimately when the product is in hand." said Jeff Sellinger, co-founder and CPO of shopkick. "Shopkick's personalization delivers a more exact science because we can target exactly the right users, shopping categories and stores. Our 'real-world click' advertising model is the best of both worlds - brands define the actions they want consumers to take, and only pay when a consumer takes the desired action - as a result it is a far more cost effective spend than traditional ad channels."
In addition to earning rewards for interacting partner brand products, rewards are also available for simply walking into the more than 2,500 retail and 160 mall locations that make up shopkick's Retail Partner Network, using shopkick's proprietary shopkick Signal technology. Walk-in rewards are currently available in all 50 states at select Target, Best Buy, Macy's, American Eagle Outfitters, Sports Authority, Crate and Barrel, Wet Seal, west elm and Simon Property Group mall locations.
In order to provide high-value rewards to consumers for actual walk-ins, the shopkick app, combined with the shopkick Signal - an inaudible sound emitted from a patent-pending device located in each participating retailer - verifies a user is in-store. This ensures that marketing dollars put into the shopkick program are being spent to reward customers who are actually present in the store, something not possible with traditional location-based applications which rely on GPS technology that has an error radius of 50-1,000 yards on mobile phones. And, because the detection occurs on the user's mobile device, the privacy of presence information is completely under the user's control.
Launched in August 2010, shopkick quickly became the largest location-based shopping app in America and reached 2 million users within a record 11 months since its launch. The shopkick App is available for free on the iPhone from the App Store at www.itunes.com/appstore/and on Android Market at http://shopkick.com/android.html
About shopkick, Inc.
shopkick, Inc. is a Palo Alto-based startup funded by Kleiner Perkins' iFund, Greylock Partners and Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn, and investor in Facebook and Zynga. In August 2010, shopkick launched the first mobile application that hands consumers high-value rewards, offers and exclusive deals at shopkick's national retail partners simply for walking into stores and malls. Even more rewards can be earned for scanning partner brand products at over 250,000 stores nationwide. In combination with a groundbreaking new location technology called "shopkick Signal", the app can verify location within feet, and because the detection occurs on the phone, privacy of presence information is completely in the users' control. Shopkick's growing partner alliance includes Best Buy, Macy's, Target, American Eagle, Crate & Barrel, The Sports Authority, Wet Seal, West Elm, Simon Property Group, Kraft Foods, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Intel, HP and The CW. shopkick is the only 100% performance-based marketing platform in the physical retail world, with measurable foot traffic and transactions at stores. The app grew to 2 million users in its first 11 months. The free shopkick app is available for the iPhone and Android.

Aug. 07--Young Irene Blecker was often the last person picked for kickball in elementary school and she was easy prey in dodge ball. But she persevered, gaining competence and confidence. By junior high and high school, she had blossomed into quite a competitor, playing volleyball, field hockey, softball and basketball.
Blecker went to Cornell University, impressed with its sports facilities for women at a time when that was an afterthought at many schools. A potential intercollegiate basketball career was derailed, in part, by a broken leg as a freshman. But she availed herself of intramural sports as an outlet for her innate competitiveness and for the lessons the games could teach.
Today, Irene Blecker is Irene Rosenfeld, chief executive of Kraft Foods -- still competing, still honing her skills and crafting strategies, still looking to be a team leader and still keeping score -- and she just announced no less a game-changer than the planned split of her Northfield-based conglomerate into two corporations.
If you're going to play the corporate game to win, it helps if you've played sports.
The transition from big man on campus to corporate quarterback is a concept that predates campuses, corporations and quarterbacks. But a generation of women is coming into executive leadership roles, the beneficiaries of similar exposure to sports and all they teach about teamwork, tenacity, leadership, how to deal with setbacks and how to attain goals.
"Sport is hugely important for people in business in general, but definitely women," said Sarah Robb O'Hagan, president of Chicago-based Gatorade North America and a Wrigleyville resident who grew up in New Zealand playing team sports such as field hockey and netball, as well as a variety of individual sports.
"It's very cliche and basic, but it's teamwork, learning how to pass the ball, learning how to play a position," said O'Hagan, 39. "The best teams on the field have exactly the same dynamics as the best teams in business. When you're leading people and you've had that experience on the field, no matter how young you were, some of that carries forward."
Coming up behind Kraft's Rosenfeld, 58, who graduated from high school in 1971, are all those American women whose opportunities as girls were enhanced by the 1972 passage of the Title IX amendments to the Civil Rights Act, which proved a boon to women's sports at schools nationwide. Title IX banned sex discrimination in educational programs and activities at institutions receiving federal money.
"It said boys and girls should have equal opportunities, and that's part of the educational process," said Women's Sports Foundation CEO Kathryn Olson, who grew up in the Chicago area and used to work here. "We know today that there are health benefits, emotional benefits and academic benefits. Girls who play sports are more likely to stay in school and get higher grades because they have the discipline from being on the team."
The WSF, a nonprofit organization founded by tennis great Billie Jean King in 1974 that looks to advance the lives of females through sports, cites studies it says show roughly four out of five female executives played sports growing up and most of them believe it helped them be successful in their subsequent careers.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who grew up in Park Ridge, has said that even though she came of age before Title IX, she was raised in "a very sports-oriented family and I was lucky enough to go to public schools in my town that had a lot of girl sports."
At a June event to launch an initiative to promote international sports exchanges, she recalled playing a junior high soccer match -- and not very well.
"For some reason," Clinton said, "that particular game really sticks in my head because these girls were from a different environment. They had it a lot harder, a lot tougher than I and my teammates did, and they threw themselves into that game. ... It wasn't just some nice way to spend an afternoon, because they were seeing it as a part of their own lives and their own ambitions and their own goals, to keep striving and striving."
Rosenfeld, who wasn't available for an interview, credits a coach with encouraging her to run for student council president, which she did, becoming the first female and first athlete at her Westbury, N.Y., high school elected to the post. She also was a member of the National Honor Society and a reporter for the school newspaper.
"I'd like to think I could have become chairman and CEO of Kraft Foods even if I hadn't been an athlete, but I truly believe I am a more focused, more competitive, more successful leader as a result of my experience in sports," said Rosenfeld, one of several successful people who talked about how sports shaped their leadership experience in tennis pro Venus Williams' 2010 book, "Come to Win: Business Leaders, Artists, Doctors and Other Visionaries on How Sports Can Help You Top Your Profession."
"The experience of honing my competitive skills really gave me a leg up as I came into the business world, because women of my generation didn't necessarily have the experience of being competitive and playing to win," Rosenfeld told Williams. "It certainly didn't hurt that I could hold my own with colleagues on the tennis court. So in addition to whatever I could do from a business perspective, playing tennis and golf was really important in terms of establishing my credibility."
Debra Cafaro, CEO of Chicago-based Ventas, once told the Tribune that growing up in Pittsburgh and watching Pirates baseball, Steelers football and college basketball taught her invaluable lessons.
Patricia Woertz, head of Decatur, Ill.-based Archer Daniels Midland, said in a 2007 PBS interview that she had a love of sports "before I sort of saw it as an opportunity to open doors or to have common ground with others" and that "sometimes some good business is done on the golf course."
Sports teaches participants how to compete without taking the competition personally, how to win with grace, how to lose.
"Sometimes it's the losses you learn the most from," O'Hagan said. "A few years ago, when we were repositioning our business for future growth, we spent a lot of time with (tennis player) Serena Williams, who had gone from being No. 1 in the world to No. 140 and back to No. 1 again. Just what she was able to share with me and my team, in terms of digging deep, knowing you're a champion, acting like a champion, bringing yourself back to what you're capable of doing -- that was such a great lesson for business."
Sports teaches one how to deal with pressure, and the pressure only increases with success.
"Billie Jean King has said for many years that pressure is a privilege, and she's right," Olson said. "Whether you're on the court or in the boardroom making the decision that Irene just made, the pressure on you at that time to make the right decision -- as difficult as that may be -- it's still a privilege that you're in that role, you're the one who has that opportunity to perform."
So, in the standings and on the scoreboard, Kraft Foods will become two companies. There will be a $16 billion North American grocery business, with mainstays such as Kraft Macaroni & Cheese and Oscar Mayer meats, and a $32 billion global snack business, with fare such as Oreo cookies, Trident gum and the brands acquired 18 months ago when Rosenfeld outmaneuvered opposition at home and abroad to acquire Cadbury Schweppes.
"One thing that is most important in getting a business to execute well and to win is to be able to have clear metrics against which to evaluate output," Rosenfeld has said. "A critical part of being an athlete is keeping score. And I think in business, people who keep score, and keep trying to better their scores, perform better."
Winning isn't everything, but it helps ensure you continue to play.

Aug. 07--Cadbury, the British chocolate company that fell into the hands of Kraft Foods last year, could find itself at the centre of another takeover battle after the US giant's announcement last week that it was splitting in two.
Less than 18 months after its hostile takeover of Cadbury, Kraft is to spin off its North American grocery arm, which has brands such as Philadelphia cream cheese, from its faster-growing international snack business, which includes Cadbury, Trident chewing gum and Oreo cookies.
However, analysts said this would make the international division an acquisition target, meaning that Cadbury could have three different owners in as many years.
Burt Flickinger, managing director of retail consultant Strategic Resource Group, said he had expected the break-up ever since Kraft employed US investment bank Goldman Sachs to look at strategic options and said the Cadbury division could now be a target.
"It could be like the proverbial rugby scrum when everyone's fighting for the ball," he said. "A lot of companies, such as Unilever, Hershey, PepsiCo, Nestle or ConAgra Foods, would be interested as they have brands that would line up well with Kraft's."
Where the company will be based or what it will be called has yet to be announced.

ABSTRACT
--------

Adams, 22, a senior at Kansas State University, was in Guatemala City on one of the steps she must climb to earn her degree and eventual certification as an English as Second Language teacher in the Kansas public schools. Adams was in a nation that was one of the cradles of the Mayan civilization, visiting a modern country nation where many of the citizens are Mayan descendants.


FULL TEXT
---------

Aug. 06--Alison Adams, Garden City High School Class of 2008, was a long way from Kansas.
One of a trio of volcanoes erupted a year ago. Temperatures were in the 70s. Guards carrying automatic weapons stood outside the grocery stores. Drivers seemed to aim rather than steer vehicles. People were warm, sensitive and into family time. The second-graders are amazing but that is true no matter where they are.
Adams, 22, a senior at Kansas State University, was in Guatemala City on one of the steps she must climb to earn her degree and eventual certification as an English as Second Language teacher in the Kansas public schools.
"I was kind of thrown into the fire right away," she said of her sojourn in the Republic of Guatemala. "Originally, I was supposed to teach second grade with another study-abroad student but because of other circumstances, I ended up teaching by myself."
Stress? Not for this blonde-haired, blue-green eyed young lady from the high plains of western Kansas. Well, maybe a little, but nothing she couldn't handle.
The school was Apoyate en Mi. Translation: Lean on Me.
"It was an amazing opportunity to see what being a teacher is all about," she said. "It was pretty intimidating at first, but I gained so much from teaching on my own I would not change a thing."
Adams was one of 13 KSU students who went to Guatemala City on July 5 and stayed three weeks. The group was part of the Center for Intercultural and Multilingual Advocacy in the KSU College of Education at Manhattan. Center Executive Director Socorro Herrera and Associate Director Tonnie Martinez led the team. The group stayed with host families.
"My host family was Pablo and Astrid Erdmenger and their 18-year-old son, Pablo," Alison recalled. "We spent many weekends with their extended family and also got to know our host brother pretty well. He drove us where we needed to go and also spoke English very well so he translated a lot for us."
A taste of culture
Food is essential. Guatemala City is like most cities on the planet.
"We had plenty of American food such as Burger King, Taco Bell, Dominos. We did try the Guatemalan version of KFC called Pollo Campero. We usually had rice or beans at most meals and tortillas. A small store just a few steps from the school sold homemade tortillas which were so good. We did try a Guatemalan dessert that is made with plantains and beans. Sounds odd but actually pretty good."
Guatemala is in Central America bordered on the north and west by the Mexican state of Chiapas, the Pacific Ocean on the south and west, Belize on the northeast, the Caribbean to the east and Honduras and El Salvador on the southeast.
Adams was in a nation that was one of the cradles of the Mayan civilization, visiting a modern country nation where many of the citizens are Mayan descendants.
She learned how ESL works because you don't always speak the language of your pupils and they definitely speak the teacher's.
Adams recalled the scenario of "a classroom of 18 students who knew extremely limited English" and herself, the teacher "who knew extremely limited Spanish."
"I learned quickly visual, acting out activities, examples and using key vocabulary words in English and Spanish is how to communicate despite the language barrier," she recalled.
Teaching in a foreign country is not required to earn the ESL certification.
"It is something I would highly recommend to anyone pursuing ESL," Adams said. "You get a crash course in teaching ESL students. Being in a country you are unfamiliar with and surrounded by a language you do not know gives you great insight into how your future ESL students will feel coming into your classroom. It provides a level of empathy you might not otherwise be able to have."
Teaching just might be in Adam's genetic code, at least on the maternal side.
Her mother is Becky Adams, a fourth-grade teacher at Florence Wilson Elementary in the Garden City Public Schools. Her father is Phil, a sales representative for Kraft Foods.
She came back with a series of impressions of Guatemala City.
She was not used to that many people.
"We were in Guatemala City the majority of our time abroad and it was definitely thousands of miles away from Kansas," she said. "Guatemala City itself has about the same number of people as the entire state of Kansas, so that was pretty difficult to wrap my mind around."
Guatemala City's population is about 2.3 million; that of Kansas, 2.8 million.
Traffic, guns and rain, oh my!
There was the traffic.
"Traffic in the city was crazy. I spent a lot of car rides cringing as we came within inches of other vehicles," she said.
And those security guards.
"Many larger stores, banks and grocery stores have armed guards outside of them with machine guns," she said. "That is something you never see in Kansas. Fortunately, we never saw armed guards using the guns but it was still a sight that took a little bit to get used to."
And the weather and the three active volcanoes.
"Guatemala City is actually in a mountainous region. It is surrounded by three volcanoes," Adams said. "The temperature was really mild the whole time we were there -- 70 to 75 Fahrenheit most days and a little chilly in the evenings. It also rained pretty much every afternoon for about an hour or so."
A day in the life
Guatemalans are laid back and focused on family values.
"We spent a lot of time with our host family and their extended family and this gave me a glance into the importance of family in the Guatemalan culture," Adams said. "Any type of birthday was celebrated with a large meal and around 20-plus family members. Lots of laughter and games. People just seemed more relaxed about most things."
She was there for Apoyate En Mi, a Christian school established to educate the poor in a nation where funding focuses on funding for private schools for the economic elite.
If the school bus breaks down on its way to the area in which they do their weekly physical education classes, drivers and teachers just fix it and keep on going.
"Education-wise, there does not seem to be as many rules and regulations in the school which can be good and bad," Adams said. "Regardless, I felt all of the kids were getting a quality education and that the school did not let setbacks get in the way of what they wanted for the kids. The students were always the top priority."
The school doesn't stop with education. Living on the streets, a frequent side effect of poverty, is almost common in the more affluent world. Some of those kids at the school she was teaching live in landfills.
Three times a week, the school's headmaster leads an expedition to distribute food.
"The first evening that I went, we made about four stops around the city to give out food," Adams said. "One of the stops was made in a landfill in the city. People that live in this landfill sort through trash to find things to eat, sell or live off of. This experience opened my eyes to the extreme poverty. Some don't have parents. Some live in the streets or the landfill. Some work late into the night or early in the morning to provide for their families."
She'll remember the teachers and pupils, all 200, starting the day with a hug.
"They soaked up everything you were teaching like sponges," Adams said. "They were such an intelligent and incredible group. They show such resilience and optimism. Some kids you would never guess the conditions that they come from. It was so amazing to see the bonds that were formed with students despite the fact that we did not speak the same language. I have heard a thousand times throughout my education classes that the teacher is the one who learns the most. After this, I could not agree more."
Back to the volcano
There is a tale about that erupting volcano.
If so, what did you see and what is your response?
"One weekend my three roommates and our host family climbed the Pacaya Volcano that is right outside of Guatemala City," Adams said. "This particular volcano actually erupted in July of last year and ended up forcing the K-State study-abroad group there at the time to go home a week early."
No eruption this year.
"Once we neared the top of the volcano there was a lot of black rock and ash from last year's eruption. There were openings in the ground where you could feel the heat."
Asked if she planned to return to Garden City and teach in USD 457, Adams replied:
"I love Garden City. It is my home and I know that I would really be able to use my ESL endorsement in Garden. I have come to love the Manhattan area, so I have a difficult decision ahead of me."

ABSTRACT
--------

Thursday's surprise announcement by Kraft Foods is the latest in a long string of marquee household names that have decided to separate themselves tax-free into separate pieces rather than divest the unwanted or slower-growing parts. Since January, spinoff announcements locally have been made by Fortune Brands Inc., Sara Lee Corp. and General Growth Properties Inc., adding their names to a lengthy national list.

Aug. 05--Corporate conglomerates that make everything from cellphones to liquor to processed American cheese are calling it quits, seeking to unlock shareholder value in a down economy by splitting into multiple companies.
Thursday's surprise announcement by Kraft Foods is the latest in a long string of marquee household names that have decided to separate themselves tax-free into separate pieces rather than divest the unwanted or slower-growing parts. Since January, spinoff announcements locally have been made by Fortune Brands Inc., Sara Lee Corp. and General Growth Properties Inc., adding their names to a lengthy national list. Motorola Inc. completed its separation into two newly named companies in January.
The streamlinings serve multiple purposes and in many cases are likely to create two kinds of investors within companies. If history is any guide, breakups create shareholder value within one to two years.
A case in point: Dr Pepper Snapple Group, which Cadbury Schweppes PLC spun off in 2008 after being pressed by activist investor Nelson Peltz. The company has since had multiple new product launches, and earlier this week its Mott's applesauce brand announced a partnership with Beech-Nut baby foods.
In May, the company raised its annual dividend by 28 percent in the second annual dividend increase.
In the case of Kraft, the company is splitting into two pieces, the $16 billion North American grocery business, whose products include Kraft Macaroni & Cheese and Oscar Mayer meats, and the $32 billion global snacking business, which will include Oreo cookies, Trident gums and the brands that came on board in last year's Cadbury acquisition.
"On the surface, this makes sense but it kind of reverses what they did with the confectionary buyout," said Joe Cornell, president of Spin-Off Advisors LLC, an investment research boutique firm. "They're basically admitting that all these synergies didn't work."
Spinoffs typically are successful because, after the formalities are over, top managers at the separate companies are eager to move the businesses forward because any rise in their compensation packages is tied to bottom-line results. That can make managers more focused, run a lean organization and take on a more entrepreneurial bent.
"With most of these spinoffs, it's better focus," Cornell said. "A lot of these conglomerates get very low multiples. It's very hard to run eight or nine businesses. It's easier to value pure plays."
Some of the current spinoff activity might be postponed transactions envisioned years ago but derailed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and the stock market's resultant travails.
Others have been prodded by influential activist investors such as Bill Ackman, Peltz and Warren Buffett, among others. During the first quarter, Peltz's investment company, Trian Fund Management, purchased 12.2 million Kraft shares.
"You've got guys beating management up with a stick," Cornell said. "Management likes to run bigger things and be kings of the big empire even though it may not be in the shareholders' best interest. Sometimes, they need to get some prodding."
Thursday, Peltz and Buffett, Kraft's largest shareholder, said they approved the company's plan to split into two entities.
For other investors, a corporate breakup gives them the opportunity to decide whether they want to hold the part of the former company that is the growth story or the tried-and-true, slower-growing piece of the business that's likely to generate steady dividends.
"It's risk versus return," said Diane Denis, a business professor at the University of Pittsburgh. "It's not a matter of growth companies are good and mature companies are bad. Some people are into holding growth stocks. They don't need income, and other people want more mature companies, steady earners that will provide some dividends."
Post-split, the boards of the separated companies will take on a different look as well, in line with the new corporate priorities. Sometimes the CEO stays and sometimes not.
Motorola's co-CEOs, Sanjay Jha and Greg Brown, each took over one company after its split, Jha to Motorola Mobility Inc. and Brown to Motorola Solutions Inc.
But at ITT, which announced its intention in January to split into three companies, none will be led by Chairman and CEO Steven Loranger. Instead, he is expected to become executive chairman of the water business, one of its spinoff entities.
And in announcing plans in July to break ConocoPhillips into two new companies, Chairman and CEO Jim Mulva also said he will retire when the split is completed.
Kraft Chairman and CEO Irene Rosenfeld said Thursday that she is committed to staying with Kraft in 2011 and 2012.

ABSTRACT

[...] with a bevy of big-name New York investors to please, from activist investor Nelson Peltz to hedge fund manager William Ackman, her audience is international. A multisport athlete from Long Island, N.Y., she went to Cornell University in 1971 and left in 1980 with three degrees: a bachelor's degree in psychology, a master's in business and a Ph.D. in marketing and statistics.

Aug. 05--Irene Rosenfeld is among the most powerful women in corporate America, and among the most private.
Forbes recently ranked Rosenfeld, the CEO of Northfield-based Kraft Foods, second on its most powerful women list, ahead of Oprah Winfrey and behind only Michelle Obama. But unlike the reputations of other prominent business figures, Rosenfeld's has been built almost entirely via boardroom maneuvers that showcased her guts and smarts and sometimes sacrificed her popularity.
When she made a bold and hostile move to take over iconic British confectioner Cadbury two years ago, the U.K. news media demonized her, describing her tactics as "World Wrestling Entertainment." Warren Buffett called the move "dumb."
That acquisition enriched Kraft shareholders, and with the stock rising 19 percent, it set the stage for the equally aggressive move announced Thursday: the planned splitting up of the company into two companies, each to be based in the Chicago area and each built on its own set of iconic brands, including Oreo, Jell-O, Oscar Mayer and Cadbury Dairy Milk.
"She's clear, she's consistent, she's gutsy," said Sheli Rosenberg, one of Chicago's most experienced female deal-makers. "The deal she just concluded proves that. She knows what she wants to achieve, and then she goes after it."
Her public persona ends there. Here stands a woman willing to challenge Buffett on business, a woman who dares to out-oracle the Oracle. On all other subjects, Rosenfeld, 58, appears beyond guarded.
Unlike other CEOs of other big-name Chicago-area companies, she doesn't lend her name to many civic organizations or court media attention. Britons took umbrage when Rosenfeld declined invitations to appear before Parliament and answer questions surrounding the Cadbury deal. A report from the House of Commons said Kraft "steered close to contempt of the House."
"She's not going to go to a lot of (charity) benefits; she's not going to get involved in a lot of things," said a well-known Chicago business figure who didn't want to be identified talking about her. "If it doesn't have something to do with her family or with being the CEO of Kraft, forget it. ... You won't see her in any other circumstance."
With her two children grown, there is very little tying Rosenfeld to local schools, neighbors or events in the affluent North Shore village of Kenilworth, where she lives. And with a bevy of big-name New York investors to please, from activist investor Nelson Peltz to hedge fund manager William Ackman, her audience is international.
This year she was the fifth-highest-paid CEO of a publicly traded company in the Chicago area and the highest-paid female CEO, with a total compensation package of $19.3 million.
Rosenfeld was driven and determined from a young age, and her childhood career ambition was to be president of the United States.
A multisport athlete from Long Island, N.Y., she went to Cornell University in 1971 and left in 1980 with three degrees: a bachelor's degree in psychology, a master's in business and a Ph.D. in marketing and statistics. At Cornell, she met her first husband, Philip Rosenfeld, with whom she had two daughters, Carol and Allison. Her husband died in 1995 at age 43. She later married Richard Illgen, an investment banker.
In an interview recorded for Cornell's website, Rosenfeld said it was an introduction to psychology class and the professor who taught it -- Jim Maas -- that persuaded her to pursue her career path.
"I served as a (teaching assistant) for him in my junior and senior years; I taught a course on the psychology of advertising, which really formed the basis for my love of marketing and advertising and psychology that has really carried over into my career to this very day," she said.
In her rare conversations with the news media, Rosenfeld is upbeat but always on point and surrounded by aides. In an interview with Forbes after the Cadbury takeover, the reporter attempted to bait her, asking if she'd "proven Buffett wrong." Rosenfeld said only that she was pleased with the outcome and respects the opinions of all of Kraft's investors. She was just as gracious, and cautious, when a British tabloid reporter turned up at her door to ask about the Cadbury deal -- she politely declined the interview request, the Daily Mirror reported.
Rosenfeld is a fan of opera and active in her synagogue, North Shore Congregation Israel. Some who know her say it is perhaps one of the few places she can be herself -- with her rabbi describing her as warm, kind and unassuming.
"She doesn't wear a badge that says, 'I am listed by Forbes,'" Rabbi Steven Mason said. "She sees herself, and wants to be, a member just like anybody else."
Khalid Razaki, a professor at Dominican University who worked for 28 years at Illinois State University and was a management consultant to Kraft, said Rosenfeld is "just more capable than us normal mortals."
"Where do you find such a powerful female executive who has such a great grasp not only of global economics but of the minutiae of the food industry?" Razaki said.
When Rosenfeld took over Kraft in 2006, she had something to prove. After 22 years behind the scenes at General Foods and Kraft, ushering brands like Kool-Aid into household names and integrating Nabisco into the company's portfolio, the company passed her up for the top post in 2003, appointing Roger Deromedi to the CEO job.
Rosenfeld left for PepsiCo's Frito-Lay but was recruited back three years later.
Kraft was a large but moribund food company, sinking under its own weight. Rosenfeld began by rearranging executive management; selling brands that couldn't command No. 1 or No. 2 market positions, such as Minute Rice and Grape-Nuts; and juicing up advertising support for brands she thought could succeed, such as Kraft Macaroni & Cheese and Oreo.
Thomas Russo, a partner with the investment firm Gardner Russo & Gardner, said Rosenfeld also worked to instill a new culture, one that was urgent and open to new ideas. One example was a new type of DiGiorno frozen pizza.
"She basically went to the team and said, 'You're right. I'm sorry my predecessor ignored you,'" Russo said. "She told them the product was worthwhile and that she wanted it in the marketplace in the next 60 days. They suddenly had massive sponsorship and the ability to run with the ball. Next year, it was a $100 million product. She referred to that frequently, both with investors and internally."
Rosenfeld then began paving the way for the $19 billion acquisition of Cadbury, selling the pizza business, which had become Kraft's most significant growth story.
"No one would have forecasted the Cadbury deal, and people gave her all kinds of grief," Rosenberg said. "But once it was accomplished, all the sudden it was the right thing to do. Hello, she's the one to come up with the idea. I'd put my money on her."

Fitch Ratings does not expect to take any immediate rating actions based on Kraft Foods Inc.'s (Kraft) announcement that its Board of Directors intends to create two publicly traded companies through a tax-free spin off of Kraft's North American grocery business (NA Grocery) to Kraft shareholders. The remaining Kraft Foods will be comprised of its global snacks business (Global Snacks).
Kraft expects to complete the spin-off by the end of 2012. The transaction is subject to the receipt of an IRS tax-free ruling, Kraft's final Board approval and other customary conditions. Approval by Kraft's shareholders is not required. Kraft has stated a commitment to maintain investment grade ratings with access to commercial paper. The ratings of each company will be based on Fitch's evaluation of the separate business profiles, capital structures and free cash flow (FCF) generation.
Each separate company will still maintain significant scale to compete effectively, despite losing some diversification. In addition, the separate companies will be able to better allocate resources to focus on their own growth profiles and strategic priorities.
NA Grocery will consist of the current U.S. Beverages, Cheese, Convenient Meals and Grocery segments and the non-snack categories in Canada and Foodservice. It will still be one of the largest food and beverage companies in North America with approximately $16 billion of estimated annual revenue. NA Grocery is expected to have operating margins above the company average, strong free cash flow generation and leading market positions in most categories. Balancing out these positive factors will be NA Grocery's slower growth in line with its mature North American packaged food categories and a high dividend. NA Grocery is also likely to have a higher effective tax rate as it loses the benefit from some overseas rate differences.
Global Snacks will have approximately $32 billion of revenues and consist of Kraft's current Europe and Developing Markets units as well as its North American snacks and confectionery businesses. Global Snacks will be a faster growth company with approximately 42% of its revenues generated in developing markets. Offsetting the strong growth prospects are lower margins, higher foreign exchange volatility and the discretionary nature of the snack category.
Kraft's current ratings continue to reflect its prominent size and scale within the global packaged foods industry, its leading market share positions in most of its categories, and many strong brand equities. Kraft's ratings factor in continued deleveraging and cost synergies from the Cadbury acquisition. For the quarter ended June 30, 2011 Kraft generated 7.1% organic net revenue growth that was well balanced with 5.5% pricing while maintaining positive 1.6% volume/mix. However, Kraft Foods North America incurred 1.5% lower volume, primarily from US Beverages and US Snacks. The company generated a mid single digit increase in operating earnings but it has experienced margin pressure as it implements higher pricing to offset a low teens percentage increase in input cost inflation for 2011.
Kraft has significant liquidity with $2.3 billion cash at June 30, 2011 and $4.5 billion of undrawn capacity on its four-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in April 2015. Fitch expects Kraft to repay and/or refinance significant upcoming maturities including $1.1 billion remaining in 2011 and $3.7 billion in 2012. Total debt at June 30, 2011 was $30 billion. For the latest 12 months ended June 30, 2011, Fitch estimates Kraft's total debt to operating EBITDA was approximately 3.6 times (x) and operating EBITDA to gross interest expense was approximately 4.7x.
Fitch currently rates Kraft and its subsidiaries as follows:
Kraft Foods Inc.
--Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB-';
--Senior unsecured debt 'BBB-';
--Credit facility 'BBB-';
--Short-term IDR 'F3';
--Commercial paper 'F3'.
Cadbury plc
--Long-term IDR 'BBB-'.
Cadbury Schweppes U.S. Finance
--Long-term IDR 'BBB-;
--Senior unsecured debt 'BBB-'
The Rating Outlook is Stable.

Aug. 04--Just 18 months after acquiring British candy maker Cadbury, Kraft Foods is breaking up.
The Northfield-based conglomerate, currently the world's second-largest food company, said it will divide itself into two publicly-traded companies next year: a $16 billion North American grocery business, and a $32 billion global snacking business. Both companies are expected to be based in Chicago.
Kraft chairman and CEO Irene Rosenfeld plans to stay on through the split, but acknowledged that her role may change after the transaction closes next year.
"At this point I will remain as chairman and CEO," Rosenfeld said in an interview. "I'm fully committed to 2011 and 2012, and do look forward to playing a leadership role when the transaction closes."
A Kraft spokesman said it would be a mistake to assume that Rosenfeld will leave the company, although her future role hasn't been identified.
Rosenfeld arrived at Kraft in 2006, and shepherded the company through its 2007 spin-off from Altria. Prior to that, Rosenfeld ran PepsiCo's Frito-Lay division.
The food maker's stock gained 2.3 percent, to $35.10, in midday trading.
The division would establish Kraft's North American grocery business as a separate company, with brands like Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Maxwell House coffee and Oscar Mayer hot dogs and meats.
Kraft's North American snacking business and its European and international divisions will make up the other company, which will include brands like Oreo, Tang, Trident, Cadbury Dairy Milk and Jacobs coffee.
Dividing the companies allows Kraft to shed its low margin, slow-growing grocery business, and focus on faster-growing, higher-margin gum, candy and snacking brands. The move will also help it build business in developing markets. Kraft is the latest in a string of Chicago-based conglomerates to announce separation plans, including Motorola, Fortune Brands and Sara Lee.
In a call with investors Thursday morning, Rosenfeld said the board-approved plan had been under consideration for years.
She said each company would benefit from standing on its own, and that shareholders should also benefit from the adjusted guidance and from having the option of adjusting investments in one or both companies.
"As we acquired Lu Biscuits and as we acquired Cadbury and began to put these businesses together and look at strategic priorities, it was clear we had very different businesses and portfolios," she said. "We believe value could be created if they were free to pursue their own strategic priorities."
Kraft management said that it's too early to provide earnings guidance for the two companies.
While Rosenfeld received a number of questions regarding the timing of the announcement, many analysts expressed support for the plan.
Alexia Howard, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein, wrote in a research note that as a result of Kraft's acquisitions of Lu Biscuits and Cadbury, "the growth engine for Kraft had become the global snack products confectionery and cookies and cracker -- plus international coffee and powdered beverages such as Tang." She added that the company's North American grocery business didn't fit well with the overall business, even though it was generating cash, she wrote.
"Given the different investment priorities and growth trajectories of the two businesses, it makes a lot of sense to separate them," Howard said.
Howard went on to suggest that activist investor Nelson Peltz may have had a hand in what some viewed as a rushed announcement. Peltz's investment company Trian Fund Management disclosed in late June that it had acquired 12 million shares in Kraft Foods. Peltz has pushed other companies to initiate spin-offs, including Cadbury's departure from beverages, which created Dr. Pepper Snapple Group.
Peltz's stake amounts to less than 1 percent of the company. Kraft's largest shareholder by far is Warren Buffett, who has a 6 percent stake.
The company has about $29 billion in outstanding debt. Executives said it is too soon to say how it will be divided, but that it will be done in a way that preserves each company's investment-grade status.
Rosenfeld said it's also too soon to say who will run the companies. She said Kraft has "an incredibly talented management team" and a "deep bench from which to populate these companies."
The move comes as more companies, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Target Corp. and various dollar stores, are increasing their grocery sections to capitalize on consumers' one-stop shopping needs.
Kraft said its plan to for a tax-free spinoff of the grocery business to shareholders will take some time, estimating that it will need a year or more to work on structure, management and other issues related to the split. Taking that into account, the company's current plan is for the split to be complete by the end of next year.
Aside from the spinoff plans, Kraft also announced that its second-quarter earnings climbed 4 percent to $976 million, or 55 cents per share, from $937 million, or 53 cents per share, a year ago. Revenue rose 13 percent to $13.88 billion from $12.25 billion. Analysts polled by FactSet predicted earnings of 58 cents per share on revenue of $13.08 billion.
Kraft also boosted its full-year forecasts for revenue from existing businesses and operating earnings. Kraft now anticipates so-called organic revenue to climb at least 5 percent, with operating earnings of at least $2.25 per share. Its prior guidance called for revenue to increase at least 4 percent, with operating earnings of at least $2.20 per share. Analysts expect earnings of $2.23 per share.

Aug. 04--BERLIN -- US-based Kraft Foods announced Thursday it planned to split itself into two companies, with one focussing on its global snacks business, and the other on North American grocery business.
The companies would be able to develop better individually, said Kraft Foods head Irene Rosenfeld.
"We have built two strong, but distinct, portfolios," she said. "Our strategic actions have put us in a position to create two great companies, each with the leadership, resources and strong market positions to realize their full potential."
Acquisitions over the past few years, including Britain's Cadbury and LU biscuit from Danone, meant the company had expanded geographically and made it "the world's leading snacks company," Kraft said.
The global snacks company would include the company's Kraft Foods Europe and developing market units, with 32 billion dollars in annual revenues of which 42 per cent of revenues was expected to come from developing markets.
Brands which would belong to the new company would include Oreo and Lu biscuits, Cadbury and Milka chocolate and Trident chewing gum.
The second grocery business would be "one of the largest food and beverage companies in North America," according to Kraft, with expected annual revenues of 16 billion dollars and which would include brands such as Miracle Whip, Philadelphia, Capri Sun and Jell-O.
The split is expected to take 12 months and should be final by the end of 2012, with the board's approval.

ABSTRACT

Pricing and Focused Investments Drove North America's Performance Broad-based pricing and focused investments in Power Brands and new products drove strong revenue growth and solid operating income performance in Kraft Foods North America. Segment operating income increased 20.7 percent, including a favorable 17.2 percentage point impact from currency and a negative 4.1 percentage points from Integration Program and acquisition-related costs.

NORTHFIELD, Ill., Aug. 4, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Kraft Foods Inc. (NYSE: KFT) today reported strong second quarter revenue growth in each geography. This strong top-line increase, coupled with aggressive cost management, also fueled solid operating income growth.
(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090420/KRAFTLOGO)
"Our second quarter results reflect the benefits of our virtuous cycle," said Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and CEO. "Consumers are responding well to our investments in marketing and innovation, and our focus on End-to-End Cost Management is paying off. As a result, we're successfully managing higher input costs through pricing and productivity, and we're well-positioned to continue our momentum and take the next step in our transformation."
Net revenues for the second quarter were $13.9 billion, up 13.3 percent, including a 2.1 percentage point benefit from accounting calendar changes(2). Organic Net Revenues grew 7.1 percent, driven by robust growth in all geographies. Pricing, which accounted for 5.5 percentage points of growth, was up strongly in each geography as pricing actions announced earlier in the year continued to be implemented. Market share performance was solid despite the company's pricing actions. Volume/mix contributed 1.6 percentage points to growth, including an approximately 1.5 percentage point benefit from the shift of Easter-related shipments into the quarter.
Operating income was $1.8 billion, and operating income margin was 13.0 percent. Underlying Operating Income, which excludes acquisition-related(3) and Integration Program(4) costs, grew 4.4 percent to $1.9 billion. Pricing essentially offset the impact of higher raw material costs, excluding the unrealized losses on hedging activities. The increase in Underlying Operating Income(1) was driven by the impact of favorable currency, volume/mix gains, lower overheads and the benefit of accounting calendar changes. Unrealized losses on hedging activities and the impact from the Starbucks CPG business(5) tempered income growth in the quarter. Underlying Operating Income margin declined 120 basis points from peak levels in the prior year quarter to 14.0 percent, essentially due to the negative impact of pricing on the margin calculation.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.55. Operating EPS(1) increased 3.3 percent to $0.62, driven primarily by currency and operating gains (including the benefit from accounting calendar changes), partially offset by unrealized losses from hedging activities.
Pricing and Focused Investments Drove North America's Performance
Broad-based pricing and focused investments in Power Brands and new products drove strong revenue growth and solid operating income performance in Kraft Foods North America.
Net revenues increased 2.5 percent. Organic Net Revenues(1) increased 4.0 percent, led by higher pricing across each business segment. Higher pricing was partially offset by lower volume/mix, including an Easter shift benefit of approximately 1.5 percentage points, which was consistent with the company's expectations. Power Brands grew approximately 4 percent.
Segment operating income declined 4.0 percent, including a negative 3.1 percentage point impact from the Starbucks CPG business and a 0.6 percentage point impact from Integration Program costs. Excluding these factors, segment operating income was essentially flat versus peak profitability levels in the prior year quarter. This performance reflected the benefits of pricing and lower SG&A offsetting higher raw material costs and lower volume/mix.
Strong Revenue and Operating Income Growth Continued in Europe
Kraft Foods Europe continued to generate strong top- and bottom-line momentum in the quarter.
Net revenues increased 26.2 percent, including a favorable 6.3 percentage point impact from accounting calendar changes. Organic Net Revenues increased 6.4 percent, including an approximately 2.5 percentage point benefit from the Easter shift. Power Brands grew nearly 8 percent.
Segment operating income increased 23.9 percent. Currency added 12.5 percentage points to growth, and was partially offset by a negative 4.6 percentage point impact from Integration Program costs. Excluding these factors, the strong increase in segment operating income was driven by lower SG&A and the benefit of accounting calendar changes, while pricing and productivity fully offset the increase in raw material costs in the quarter.
Strong Broad-Based Growth in Developing Markets
Kraft Foods Developing Markets drove strong top- and bottom-line growth across each region.
Net revenues increased 22.3 percent, including a favorable 2.3 percentage point impact from accounting calendar changes. Organic Net Revenues(1) grew 13.5 percent, driven by strong volume/mix growth and favorable pricing. Power Brands grew nearly 20 percent. The Easter shift benefited growth by approximately 0.5 percentage points. The Latin America and Asia Pacific regions each grew double-digits, while the CEEMA(6) region grew nearly 10 percent behind improving economic conditions.
Segment operating income increased 20.7 percent, including a favorable 17.2 percentage point impact from currency and a negative 4.1 percentage points from Integration Program and acquisition-related costs. Excluding these factors, the increase in segment operating income was driven by higher pricing and volume/mix gains, partially offset by higher input costs, a double-digit increase in advertising and consumer support and higher overheads.
OUTLOOK
The company increased its expectations for organic net revenue growth from at least 4 percent to at least 5 percent, and Operating EPS from at least $2.20 to at least $2.25.
"We've raised our 2011 guidance to reflect our strong operating results and favorable currency through the first half," said David Brearton, Executive Vice President and CFO. "Despite rising input costs and a volatile economic environment, aggressive cost management coupled with strong revenue growth gives us confidence that we will deliver top-tier performance for the year."

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains a number of forward-looking statements. Words, and variations of words such as "believe," continue," "expect," "will," and similar expressions are intended to identify our forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, our outlook for Organic Net Revenue growth and Operating EPS; our momentum and the next step in our transformation; Starbucks' actions; our Outlook, including, continued cost management and strong revenue growth; and our intention to create two independent companies. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, our failure to successfully separate the company, continued volatility of and increases in input costs, pricing actions, increased competition, continued consumer weakness, weakness in economic conditions and tax law changes. Please also see our risk factors, as they may be amended from time to time, set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Kraft Foods disclaims and does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement in this press release, except as required by applicable law or regulation.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP").
The company's top-line measure is organic net revenues, which excludes the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures (including the Starbucks CPG business), currency and accounting calendar changes. The company uses organic net revenues and corresponding ratios as non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes this measure better reflects revenues on a going-forward basis and provides improved comparability of results because it excludes the volatility of currency, and the one-time impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and accounting calendar changes from net revenues.
The company uses underlying operating income, which is defined as operating income excluding costs related to: the Integration Program; and acquisition-related costs, including transaction advisory fees, U.K. stamp taxes and the impact of the Cadbury inventory revaluation. The company uses underlying operating income and corresponding ratios as non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes this measure better reflects operating income on a going-forward basis and provides improved comparability of results because it excludes certain impacts related to the Cadbury acquisition from operating income.
The company uses Operating EPS, which is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Kraft Foods from continuing operations excluding costs related to: the Integration Program; acquisition-related costs, including transaction advisory fees, U.K. stamp taxes and the impact of the Cadbury inventory revaluation; acquisition-related financing fees; and the impact of a deferred tax charge resulting from the recently enacted U.S. health care legislation. Management believes this measure better reflects earnings per share on a going-forward basis and provides improved comparability of results because it excludes certain impacts related to the Cadbury acquisition and other one-time impacts from earnings per share.
See the attached schedules for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures referred to above to the most comparable GAAP financial measures for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company's results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP measures the company is using may differ from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Because GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis are neither accessible nor deemed to be significantly different from the non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort, with regard to the non-GAAP financial measures in the company's Outlook, the company has not provided that information.
SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME
Management uses segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. The company believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), certain components of its U.S. pension plan cost (which is a component of cost of sales and marketing, administration and research costs), general corporate expenses (which are a component of marketing, administration and research costs) and amortization of intangibles for all periods presented. The company centrally manages pension plan funding decisions and determination of discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions. Therefore, the company allocates only the service cost component of its U.S. pension plan expense to segment operating income. The company excludes the unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities from segment operating income to provide better transparency of its segment operating results. Once realized, the company records the gains and losses on hedging activities within segment operating results. Accordingly, the company does not present these items by segment because they are excluded from the segment profitability measure that management reviews.
(1)Please see discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this press release.
(2)In the second quarter of 2011, Kraft Foods changed the consolidation date for certain operations of its Europe and Developing Markets segments, resulting in favorable impacts to net revenues of approximately $360 million (or $316 million excluding the effect of foreign currency) and to operating income of approximately $50 million (or $44 million excluding the effect of foreign currency).
(3)Acquisition-related costs include transaction advisory fees, UK stamp taxes, and the impact of the Cadbury inventory revaluation.
(4)Integration Program costs are defined as the costs associated with combining the Kraft Foods and Cadbury businesses, and are separate from those costs associated with the acquisition.
(5)Effective March 1, 2011, Starbucks unilaterally took control of the sale and distribution of the packaged coffee business in grocery stores and other channels by terminating its agreements with Kraft Foods and in a manner that Kraft Foods believes violates the terms of those agreements.

ABSTRACT
--------

[...] Kraft Foods' snacks business is focused largely on capitalizing on global consumer snacking trends, building its strength in fast-growing developing markets and in instant consumption channels; the North American grocery business is investing to grow revenue in line with its categories in traditional grocery channels through product innovation and world-class marketing, while driving superior margins and cash flows.

NORTHFIELD, Ill., Aug. 4, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Kraft Foods Inc. (NYSE: KFT) today announced that its Board of Directors intends to create two independent public companies: A high-growth global snacks business with estimated revenue (1) of approximately $32 billion and a high-margin North American grocery business with estimated revenue of approximately $16 billion. The company expects to create these companies through a tax-free spin-off of the North American grocery business to Kraft Foods shareholders.
(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090420/KRAFTLOGO)
"As our second quarter results once again show, our businesses are benefiting from a virtuous cycle of growth and investment, which we fully expect will continue," said Chairman and CEO Irene Rosenfeld. "We have built two strong, but distinct, portfolios. Our strategic actions have put us in a position to create two great companies, each with the leadership, resources and strong market positions to realize their full potential. The next phase of our development recognizes the distinct priorities within our portfolio. The global snacks business has tremendous opportunities for growth as consumer demand for snacks increases around the world. The North American grocery business has a remarkable set of iconic brands, industry-leading margins, and the clear ability to generate significant cash flow."
Strategic Rationale
Over the last several years, Kraft Foods has transformed its portfolio by expanding geographically and by building its presence in the fast-growing snacking category. A series of strategic acquisitions, notably of LU biscuit from Danone and of Cadbury Plc, together with the strong organic growth of its Power Brands, have made Kraft Foods the world's leading snacks company. At the same time, the company has continued to invest in product quality, marketing and innovation behind its iconic North American brands, while implementing a series of cost management initiatives. As a result, the company has delivered strong results in very challenging economic conditions.
Having successfully executed its transformation plan, and 18 months into the Cadbury integration, the company has, in fact, built a global snacking platform and a North American grocery business that now differ in their future strategic priorities, growth profiles and operational focus. For example, Kraft Foods' snacks business is focused largely on capitalizing on global consumer snacking trends, building its strength in fast-growing developing markets and in instant consumption channels; the North American grocery business is investing to grow revenue in line with its categories in traditional grocery channels through product innovation and world-class marketing, while driving superior margins and cash flows.
Over the course of Kraft Foods' strategic transformation, the Board of Directors and management have continually explored opportunities to further enhance performance and increase long-term shareholder value and believe that creating two independent public companies is the logical next step. Specifically, detailed review by the Board and management has shown that these two businesses would now benefit from being run independently of each other, rather than as part of the same company.
The company believes that creating two public companies would offer a number of opportunities:
Each business would focus on its distinct strategic priorities, with financial targets that best fit its own markets and unique opportunities.
Each would be able to allocate resources and deploy capital in a manner consistent with its strategic priorities in order to optimize total returns to shareholders.
Investors would be able to value the two companies based on their particular operational and financial characteristics and thus invest accordingly.
Creating Two Great Companies
Global snacks will consist of the current Kraft Foods Europe and Developing Markets units as well as the North American snacks and confectionery businesses. As an independent company, global snacks would have estimated revenues of approximately $32 billion and a strong growth profile across numerous fast-growing, attractive markets. Approximately 75 percent of revenues would be from snacks around the world, and approximately 42 percent would come from developing markets, including a diversified presence in numerous highly attractive emerging markets. The business would have a strong presence in the fast-growing and high-margin instant consumption channel. The non-snacks portion of the portfolio would consist primarily of powdered beverages and coffee, which have a strong growth and margin profile in developing markets and Europe. Key brands would include Oreo and LU biscuits, Cadbury and Milka chocolates, Trident gum, Jacobs coffee, and Tang powdered beverages.
The North American grocery business would consist of the current U.S. Beverages, Cheese, Convenient Meals and Grocery segments and the non-snack categories in Canada and Food Service. With approximately $16 billion in estimated revenue, this business would be one of the largest food and beverage companies in North America. Its portfolio would include many of the most popular food brands on the continent, with leadership positions in virtually every category in which it competes.
The North American grocery business would have a highly competitive retail presence, cost leadership and a continued commitment to innovation and marketing excellence. North America's strategic priorities would be to build on its leading market positions by growing in line with its categories while maintaining a sharp focus on its cost structure. Capitalizing on the investments that the company has made during its transformation, an independent North American business would be managed to deliver reliable revenue growth; strong margins and free cash flow; and a highly competitive dividend payout. Key brands would include Kraft macaroni and cheese, Oscar Mayer meats, Philadelphia cream cheese, Maxwell House coffee, Capri Sun beverages, Jell-O desserts and Miracle Whip salad dressing.
Management is targeting capital structures to maintain investment-grade ratings with access to commercial paper for each new entity.
Next Steps
Management is developing detailed plans for the Board's further consideration and final approval. To execute the transaction requires further work on structure, management, governance, and other matters, which will take approximately 12 or more months. The current target is to launch the new companies before year-end 2012. The company will provide interim updates as appropriate. Throughout the process, management will remain focused on continuing to realize the benefits of the Cadbury integration and delivering strong business results.
"Our employees' hard work and accomplishments have transformed Kraft Foods and enabled us to take this next step in the company's evolution," said Rosenfeld. "Our global snacks and North America grocery businesses both have terrifically talented and dynamic people. I'm confident that we will maintain the winning spirit that has been key to our success." She continued, "The focus and other benefits that come from creating two independent companies will provide even greater opportunities for our people and our brands."
Any transaction would be subject to customary conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals, an opinion from tax counsel and a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to ensure the tax-free status of the spin-off of the North American grocery business to our shareholders, execution of inter-company agreements, further due diligence as appropriate, and final approval by the company's Board of Directors.
The company's financial advisors are Centerview Partners, Evercore Partners and Goldman Sachs.
CONFERENCE CALL
Kraft Foods will host a conference call for investors to review this announcement at 8 a.m. EDT today. Access to a live audio webcast with accompanying slides is available at www.kraftfoodscompany.com, and a replay of the event will also be available on the company's website.

Aug. 02--ALTON -- Despite the muggy heat Monday evening, dozens of families left air conditioning behind to enjoy free food, prizes, activities and a chance to meet police and firefighters and see their equipment.
This time, Alton's ninth annual National Night Out kickoff was held at Riverfront Park, with its fountains shooting up from the plaza in front of the amphitheater a hit with the young ones. A racecar-themed bounce house also was popular, especially with siblings Nicole Johnson, 9, and her brother, Dawson, 5, of Alton.
"The bounce house," both children replied when asked their favorite part of the event.
They did not stop to chat as they stamped carved potato halves onto colorful paint, then onto sheets of paper. The paper, which youngsters took home, kept with the potato theme and advertised Alton Marketplace's Farmers and Artisans Market.
"You can come down and meet the farmers that grow food you eat," Marketplace Executive Director Sara McGibany said.
"They are having a blast," said dad Dave Johnson. It was the first time the Johnsons attended the kickoff.
Wendy Hagen said the same thing, as her son, Liam Volk, 4, emerged from a police vehicle.
"We came just for fun," the Alton woman said. "We came down to meet police and have some fun. He's having a ball."
The actual 28th National Night Out is tonight, when neighborhoods hold anti-drug and crime prevention events; show support for local anti-crime programs; strengthen police-community partnerships and neighborhood spirit; and to show that neighborhoods are organized and fighting back against crime and drugs.
The National Association of Town Watch initiated the yearly observance and is the national sponsor. More information can be found at www.nationalnightout.org.
More than 15,000 communities throughout the United States, its territories, military bases and in Canada held activities on the 2010 National Night Out that involved 37 million participants, the website says. Among those events were block parties, flashlight walks, cookouts, parades and exhibits.
At an opening ceremony, Alton Police Chief David Hayes said he was "proud to be down here with a good group of people."
"We are sending a message to criminals that our neighborhoods are organizing and fighting back," Hayes said.
He encouraged the crowd of a couple hundred to hold a barbecue or other event tonight -- even if they only leave on their porch lights -- to show support.
Any neighborhood wanting a police officer to stop by at their event should call the Alton Police Department at (618) 463-3505, he said.
Hayes said police regularly meet with residents at neighborhood meetings to learn about problems and address citizens' issues.
One such resident, Scott Garner Sr., whose son, Scott Jr., was shot to death a few blocks from his home in 2007, said he is setting up a watch group because of burglaries in his neighborhood.
Mayor Tom Hoechst proclaimed Monday as National Night Out in the city of Alton, asking citizens to become aware of crime-fighting efforts in the city. State Rep. Dan Beiser, D-Alton, complimented Hayes for holding the event.
"It helps prevent crime and makes the community we live in a better place," Beiser said.
State Sen. William Haine, D-Alton, said he remembers attending the first kickoff in Haskell Park and said he plans to turn on his porch light tonight.
"If this area is known for one thing, it's an active citizens' group," Haine said. "We also have the finest police officers in the Police Department, the Sheriff's Department and Illinois State Police."
The Madison County Sheriff's Department brought its fortified Bearcat transport vehicle, a smaller version of the Alton department's Ballistic Engineered Armored Response (BEAR) vehicle.
The vehicles were parked next to each other, and with each, children scurried inside to climb on the side seats and peek outside the turret on top.
"They still want to know what it is used for, and they want to know if it is bullet-proof," said Sgt. T.J. Hernandez of the Sheriff's Department.
Pfc. Mike Metzler, of APD, showed a variety of crime scene equipment and handed out toy tattoos and plastic bracelets that said, "Police + Community, National Night Out."
The Alton Fire Department brought a rescue truck, pumper and its safety (smoke) house trailer to delight of many of the youngsters.
Thirteen members of the A-Town Steppers gave a lively performance; attendees could win scooters, bicycles from Target and a $50 credit gift card from Scott Credit Union. Everyone could partake of free water and other beverages, frozen pops, hot dogs, chips and candy.
Sandy Crawford, of the Drug Free Alton Coalition, had a table full of information, including brochures on use of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamines.
The evening closed with a showing of the classic movie, "Stand by Me," on the amphitheater.
Sponsors of the 2011 Alton National Night Out Kickoff are Dave Mungenast Alton Toyota Scion, Saint Anthony's Health Center and Alton Memorial Hospital, City of Alton and its police and fire departments, Target and Kraft Foods, Drug Free Alton, Alton Weed and Seed Strategy neighborhood problem-solving group members, Robert "Chick" Fritz Inc. distributing, Alton Park and Recreation Department and the Alton Public Works Department.

Aug. 02--KENOSHA-- Gov. Pat Quinn traveled to a Wisconsin food bank Tuesday to hold up his end of a losing bet that the Bears would defeat the Green Bay Packers in last January's NFC Championship game.
Quinn wore a Packers jersey while stocking shelves with dried fruit, stuffing, chicken broth and Wisconsin-friendly macaroni and cheese. The food was donated by Walgreens, Kraft Foods and other Illinois companies.
"I've been a Bears fan all my life, and this is not easy," Quinn said during his appearance at the Shalom Center Food Pantry. "I've never worn a Packers jersey and I hope I never have to wear one again."
Quinn sported a No. 75 jersey, the number worn by offensive tackle Bryan Bulaga, who was born in Illinois. Not to be outdone, he layered it over a Gale Sayers jersey, joking the former Bear and Hall of Fame member was "closer to my heart."
Quinn made the wager seven months ago with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican. But it took the Chicago Democrat a while to make good, acknowledging he stayed away in part because of unrest over labor issues in the state.
Despite having to wear the "uncomfortable" jersey, Quinn said he was happy to make the bet that ultimately benefited people in need. If Quinn had won, Walker would have volunteered and made donations to a Chicago food bank.
"I think it's very important that we bring attention to the need that there are a lot of good people in Illinois and Wisconsin and across America that need a helping hand when it comes to getting decent food," Quinn said.
The governor added that he hopes the situation inspires the Bears to perform better this season, though Walker said he's ready to host Quinn up north again soon.
"I look forward to having him back when the Green Bay Packers repeat as Super Bowl champions," Walker said in a statement.

Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/105324/india_food_and_dri) has announced the addition of the "India Food and Drink Report Q3 2011" report to their offering.
The lagged impact of the central bank's aggressive monetary tightening is expected to take the steam out of domestic demand over the coming quarters. Looking ahead, BMI maintains their view that the Indian consumer-facing sectors provide very exciting opportunities for consumer goods manufacturers, thanks to the country's favourable demographics, rising disposable incomes and strong macroeconomic fundamentals. As such, big multinationals such as Carrefour, Wal-Mart, The Coca-Cola Company and Starbucks are likely to continue inching their way into the Indian consumer-facing sectors to take advantage of the sectors' enormous growth potential.
Headline Industry Data

Key Company Trends
Indians Craving For More Confectionery
A month after US coffee giant Starbucks made its Indian debut, Dunkin' Donuts announced that it will be bringing its sugary treats to India as it looks to capitalise on the country's increasing out-of-home food consumption and rising affluence. Dunkin' is setting up its stores in the country through a franchise with Jubilant Foodworks (JFL). Meanwhile, Kraft Foods is reaping the fruits of its Cadbury acquisition. Cadbury India recorded revenue growth of 27% for the year ending December 2010.
Huge Scope For Premium Growth In Alcohol
SABMiller India has witnessed a drop in its domestic market share from 35% to around 20% within a span of three years. Rather than bruising a market share battle through price competition, SABMiller India is looking to build a strong foothold in the more profitable Indian states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Haryana and Rajasthan. SABMiller's motive can be linked to the long-term outlook for the country's beer sector. By entrenching its premium brands among Indian consumers and targeting the higher-end markets.

July 29--The word innovation gets tossed around a lot as the thing that will propel the United States forward.
I'd dare say most people would interpret that to mean developing alternative energy sources or inventing lifesaving medical treatments.
But John Cowles sees innovation as crucial to his company, which turns polyurethane foam into all sorts of products.
Six weeks into his tenure as chief executive officer of Upper Providence-based FXI, Cowles explained how the company was exploring the use of foam in construction products, health care, and other areas beyond its major markets -- bedding and autos.
FXI, which emerged from bankruptcy two years ago, is building a research- and-development center in Aston, he said. The current R&D operation employs about 30 people in Eddystone and is scheduled to move later in the year.
Outside of a product introduced for rain gutters last fall, Cowles didn't want to get too specific about where the company's foam may show up next.
One-third of FXI's $750 million in annual revenue comes from the auto industry, with foam going into door panels, under carpets, and inside dashboards. Another third depends on the mattress business, which seems intent on baffling consumers with "sleep systems" and "space-age materials."
The rest of FXI's energy is directed toward myriad applications, including footwear, medical devices, electronic equipment, and personal-care products. You may have used a foam sponge to mop your kitchen floor, or an eye-shadow brush or lip-gloss applicator made with FXI-supplied foam. Carpet cushioning, ink-jet cartridges, exercise mats, and handle grips for some baseball bats all incorporate foam.
Cowles, whose background includes stints at several consumer-products companies such as George Weston Bakeries, Kraft Foods, and Campbell Soup, is also trying to nudge the company to become more consumer-focused. That would seem to be quite a shift for FXI, which is primarily a business-to-business company.
But Cowles, 48, said he believed companies that were focused on making products used in other companies' products needed to understand what the ultimate consumer wanted.
Along with a recovering U.S. economy, that type of innovation is what would help FXI attain its goal of doubling revenue to $1.5 billion in five years, according to Cowles.
Such growth would be welcomed by longtime employees, who endured two trips through bankruptcy court by FXI's predecessor company, Foamex International Inc., in the last decade. Today, FXI has about 2,000 employees, of whom 130 work in Delaware County.
The privately held manufacturer has 11 foam-pouring factories and seven fabrication/warehouse operations across the United States. It also has a factory in Mexico.
The price of crude oil weighs heavily on FXI. After all, polyurethane is derived from petroleum. Closing at $97.44 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange Thursday, the price of oil isn't playing havoc with FXI's cost structure, but Cowles would be the first to applaud should the price fall for this major input of production.

MUMBAI: Chicago-headquartered Kraft Foods, which acquired Cadbury last January for $18.9 billion, is earning a double bonanza from British chocolate maker's Indian operations.
Not only is Cadbury Kraft India one of the fastest growing operations for Kraft globally, revenues spurted by 40% in January-March 2011 quarter, the domestic business is proving to be a ripe hunting ground for talent.
Within a year-and-a-half of acquiring Cadbury, the $50 billion Kraft has picked up 21 managers for global and regional roles from the Indian affiliate.
These include Sunil Sethi director, sales, who has moved as general manager of Kraft Malaysia; marketing honcho Bharath Sastry has taken over as marketing director of Kraft Indonesia; Pravin Shetty from finance is now in Singapore as manager, business analysis; Mohit Wadhawan from logistics & customer operations too has a role in Singapore, as manager, manufacturing strategy; and Nikhil Rao from marketing has moved into a global role in chocolates in Zurich. In addition there are officials who are based in India but handling projects for other nations.
"Something like this has never ever happened in any other market wherever Kraft is present globally. And I think that it shows the commendable flexibility of Kraft to stick to its `best of both' strategy," points out Anand Kripalu, President, South Asia & Indo China, & Managing Director, Cadbury India. 'Best of both' refers to the Kraft-Cadbury combine's efforts to integrate the cultures, heritage and people of both brands.

Cambria was 10 years old by this time and had made its mark as the largest manufacturer of quartz countertops and table surfaces in the U.S. For more than 60 years spanning three generations, the family also made tons of cheese annually for the likes of Kraft Foods.

FULL TEXT
---------

July 27--The road to owning Sun Country Airlines began at a table for three more than a year ago in the dining room of Ciao Bella restaurant, a popular business-lunch destination in Bloomington.
It was a get-acquainted meeting for Marty Davis of Cambria Holdings and Sun Country CEO Stan Gadek arranged by WCCO Radio executive Mick Anselmo, whose station was the recipient of considerable advertising dollars from both parties.
At the time, Davis didn't have buying an airline on his mind; Gadek wasn't there to make a sales pitch. Davis wanted to talk about marketing ideas with the airline's magazine; Gadek wanted feedback about service from a Sun Country frequent flier.
Today, 14 months after that lunch, Davis is Sun Country's new owner and Gadek is his man at the helm. The deal, which combined a once nearly broke airline with a southern Minnesota family known for their quartz countertops and cheese production, closed last week.
What happened in between is a study of unintended consequences, business instincts and forged relationships.
Even the Minnesota Twins can take part of the credit for the transaction. It was at several baseball games last season sitting behind home plate that Davis and Gadek strengthened their relationship.
"He's our kind of people," Davis said of Gadek from his Eden Prairie office last week, one day after the sale.
After their initial lunch meeting in May 2010, Davis, his family and Cambria CFO Jim Ward started kicking the tires at Sun Country with a little more vigor. By the fall their interest started to build.
"They were in bankruptcy but we knew at some point they'd be for sale," Davis recalled.
"We started talking off and on," Gadek said. "They were interested in diversifying. They were looking for well-run companies with strong brands, and we fit that."
Cambria was 10 years old by this time and had made its mark as the largest manufacturer of quartz countertops and table surfaces in the U.S. For more than 60 years spanning three generations, the family also made tons of cheese annually for the likes of Kraft Foods.
Sun Country was part of the corporate estate of Tom Petters, the former Wayzata businessman who businesses went into bankruptcy after a $3.65 billion Ponzi scheme run through Petters Companies Inc., crashed and burned.
Davis and his front office were Sun Country regulars as passengers so they knew the airline from the outside.
"Sun Country as a brand had a very good reputation," Davis said. "It was impressive to see the quality of service they offered. I don't know that we started out wanting to buy an airline but it was exposed to us as a business and once we looked at the books we were comfortable with the business model. We saw it as a good business opportunity."
By the start of 2011, Davis was ready to get serious about buying the airline. "We were aware there were other bidders but we didn't know who they were," he said.
Gadek said he'd been fielding calls from potential investors since late 2009 but nothing serious had developed.
By March, the Davis group had an offer on the table for something north of $24 million, the minimum price that bankruptcy trustee Doug Kelley said was acceptable. Kelley already had rejected offers in the $15 million range.
The Davis proposal impressed Kelley so much that he told the bankruptcy court that a sale was "imminent."
But Kelley, feeling pressure from creditors of Petters, determined that an auction of the airline could bring a better price.
Changing economics
"We had four or five bidders," Kelley said. "Then all that stuff happened -- Egypt, Libya, the tsunami."
All of which caused economic shudders in the U.S. and abroad and sent jet fuel prices skyward.
"You start tinkering with airline fuel costs and that just complicates the pro formas" on which bids were based, Kelley said.
The economics of the moment also caused jitters for Davis. "We had some anxious nights, but it didn't change our interest."
A Sun Country deal seemingly languished for months as bids were submitted, revised and submitted again. Identities of the interested parties were known only to Kelley and his legal team.
"We visited a number of players, and then they'd visit Gadek," Kelley said.
By May, one year after the foretelling Ciao Bella luncheon, the Davis group had a new offer on the table -- higher than its original bid -- and in cash.
"That was very attractive," Kelley said. "Marty and I had a handshake and the deal stuck."
After several more weeks of due diligence by the Davis law firm of Briggs & Morgan, the deal was finalized and announced Wednesday.
Davis said he has no plans to change management, operations or the frequent flier program at his new acquisition.
Right now, the board of directors is Davis, Ward and Gadek with the Davis family on call.
'I'm not going to meddle'
If Davis has any plans for the airline, he's not saying. "We're not going to be in the limelight much," he said. "I'm not going to meddle."
Sun Country turned a $13 million profit last year after several not-so-good years. The airline also is in the black for the first half of 2011.
"Every business is a risk. Even the countertop business is risky," Davis said. "But Sun Country has a niche, is well-run and that's the key."
"I'll go see Stan when he wants to see me," Davis said. "I want to be a supportive owner. I want to learn and be in the background."

July 27--Comcast Corp. is moving to earn money off its popular video-on-demand service by "dynamically" inserting advertisements into TV reruns.
NBCUniversal, which is controlled by Comcast, is the first programmer to agree to a deal. Comcast executive Marcien Jenckes said Tuesday that negotiations with other TV networks were "very far along" because the new ad-insertion technology would allow them to earn new revenue on existing TV shows.
Until now, networks could change advertisements on VOD shows, but only monthly. The new technology allows new ads to be inserted into the shows daily -- a functionality that advertisers were seeking, officials said.
Most of the new advertising revenue will go to programming networks. But Comcast will own a small part of the new advertising inventory. Also, Comcast could earn commissions on the advertisements sold through its Spotlight division.
Comcast says there are 350 million VOD downloads a month. While VODs are popular, programming networks have worried that the huge volume of downloads was reducing viewership of first-run TV shows. The ad-insertion technology could alleviate those concerns by allowing the networks to earn new revenue.
NBCUniversal, based in New York, is controlled by Comcast, and it says that content from USA Network, E!, Bravo Media, and Oxygen Media will be part of the program. Chrysler and Kraft Foods have agreed to advertise through the program. Content from other NBCUniversal networks could be added later in the year.
Comcast says the technology will be available to other cable companies in 2012 through Canoe Ventures, which is an industry consortium.

SANTA ANA, Calif., July 27, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Grubb & Ellis Company (NYSE: GBE), a leading real estate services and investment firm, today announced that Kraft Foods has agreed to extend its contract for facilities and project management services through 2016. The extension, which represents an early renewal of Grubb & Ellis' existing relationship with Kraft Foods, covers 41 locations throughout the U.S. and Canada totaling more than 4 million square feet of property.

NEW YORK, July 27, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- We are in an exciting age in business--one powered not just by new technologies but by ideas. In this new era, a single brilliant idea has the capacity to create industry giants and build entirely new categories. Google, Dyson, eBay, Apple, Facebook, and others offer ample evidence of the nearly limitless potential of creative thinking and continual invention.
This summer, Euro RSCG Worldwide will celebrate the power and potential of ideas with the publication of THE CREATIVE BUSINESS IDEA BOOK: TEN YEARS OF BREAKTHROUGH THINKING. A decade ago, the communications company discarded the traditional ways of doing business and began building brands around what it would trademark as Creative Business Ideas(R)--ideas so powerful they can transform businesses, build categories, and alter consumer perceptions, over time or sometimes even overnight. THE CREATIVE BUSINESS IDEA BOOK shows the impact of creative strategy on companies around the world and aims to inspire a new generation of talent.
"Over the past decade creativity has emerged as one of the most significant competitive advantages in business," said David Jones, global CEO of Havas and Euro RSCG Worldwide. "Today you can no longer buy attention, you have to earn it. And in a world of more and more messages, shorter and shorter attention spans, and smaller screens, powerful creative ideas that cut through have never been so critically important. This book celebrates some of the best examples of brilliant creative thinking driving profitable growth"
Drawing on cases from around the globe, THE CREATIVE BUSINESS IDEA BOOK challenges marketers and business leaders in every category to rethink how business is done. Among the more than two dozen campaigns showcased in the book are:
McDonald's: "Come as You Are"
Dulux: "Let's Color"
Evian: "Live Young"
Coca-Cola: "Path to Purchase"
Air France: "Making the Sky the Best Place on Earth"
Nokia: "Nokia Game"
eBay: "You Are eBay"
The 29 cases are arranged according to five areas of focus: Unleashing Human Viruses, Reinvigorating Businesses and Brands, Thinking Bigger Than the Business, Targeting the New Consumer, and Compelling Change.
In addition, the book contains insights and recollections from creative, account, and management executives across the company, as well as essays on relevant topics such as how to create an effective viral campaign, the new face of luxury, and what to expect from our digital future.
"Relevancy is vital today," said Mercedes Erra, executive president of Euro RSCG Worldwide. "The utility of brands is what people question most, and so engaging with consumers has to be linked with how brands help people in their daily lives. Creative Business Ideas are more than a tool; they're a way of thinking that's focused on understanding what drives people to get involved. To survive, brands have to adapt their DNA in order to meet people's challenges, and, if necessary, they need to have the courage to change. Creative Business Ideas are media-neutral ideas that deliver powerful creative work. They have the power to transform a company, redefine its scope, and enlarge its perspective, from product to service."
Creative Business Ideas have been a driving factor in the success of Euro RSCG over the last decade. Since Creative Business Ideas became the agency's mission--and promise to clients--Euro RSCG has been named Global Agency of the Year by Advertising Age and Agency Network of the Year by Campaign, and it has been ranked as the largest agency by number of global brands for five years running.
Naomi Troni, global chief marketing officer of Euro RSCG Worldwide, said: "Those of us who worked on the book were inspired by the breadth of thinking and the brilliance of the ideas in the showcased campaigns. The book is meant to celebrate and inspire, and we're all looking forward to what the next decade of Creative Business Ideas will bring."
THE CREATIVE BUSINESS IDEA BOOK will be available for purchase on Amazon.com from late July 2011.

RedPrairie Corporation, a global supply chain and retail technology provider, announced today that six of Gartner's top 10 consumer packaged goods (CPG) leaders in 2011 are using RedPrairie's supply chain execution solutions.
According to Gartner, the CPG top 10 supply chain leaders for 2011 include: Procter & Gamble (ranked 1st), PepsiCo (2nd), The Coca-Cola Company (3rd), Colgate-Palmolive (4th), Unilever (5th), Nestle (6th), Kraft Foods (7th), Kimberly-Clark (8th), General Mills (9th), and British American Tobacco (10th).
The rankings of CPG companies were included in the Consumer Products Perspective research for Gartner's 2011 Supply Chain Top 25 report, which analyzed data from Fortune Global 500, Fortune 1000 and Forbes Global 2000 companies to identify the companies throughout the world and across several industries that best exemplify the ideal for today's supply chain.
"RedPrairie is proud to have so many of its customers leading the field in Gartner's report," said Dawn Andre, RedPrairie's industry marketing director. "RedPrairie helps these CPG leaders to optimize every move to help ensure agile, compliant and efficient operations across the globe. This is further validation that our best-of-breed supply chain solutions can help ensure visibility and collaboration between manufacturers, distributors, and retailers."
RedPrairie's superior supply chain platform enables leading CPG companies such as General Mills, Kimberly-Clark, Procter & Gamble and Unilever to cost-effectively balance operational excellence and innovation in the supply chain across the globe. In today's volatile global market conditions, CPG companies use RedPrairie's Commerce in Motion solutions to continuously improve asset management, inventory and labor performance - all while delivering a great customer experience and reinforcing the value of their brands.
"RedPrairie's collaborative approach helps CPG companies gain critical visibility into inventory and information from trading partners, enabling them to rapidly respond to changes in demand," said Andre.
One example of RedPrairie's Commerce in Motion collaborative approach is its efficient handling of product recalls. CPG companies can better manage the recall process by connecting with trading partners through a collaborative network where information is consolidated and quickly accessible. This provides fast, effective track and trace capabilities when recalls occur, enabling CPG companies and their partners to quickly institute network-wide holds and notifications, initiate product returns or destruction, and production of reports required by the Food and Drug Administration.
"CPG companies are faced with significant, dynamic challenges every day in their business," said Andre. "Globalization, the rise of social networks, product safety and supply chain shocks such as natural disasters can all have significant impact on supply chains, brands, and ultimately, profitability. RedPrairie is uniquely positioned in this dynamic environment to help today's global supply chain partners optimize their inventory, improve employee productivity, increase speed to market, and more effectively connect consumers with the brands they demand."

Business Facilities magazine, a leading trade publication targeted at site selectors, has ranked the Greater Rochester Region first on its list of job growth leaders in its 2011 metro rankings.
The list measures job growth in mid-sized metropolitan statistical areas. In the same issue, Genesee County was also ranked third on a list of best food processing regions, based on metropolitan food processing industry growth.
The Greater Rochester Region falls into the mid-sized category based on overall average employment. A government survey of employment indicated that the Rochester MSA posted the most significant percentage increase in employment in the mid-sized category in the 12-month period between April 2010 and April 2011.
The completion of the Genesee Valley Agri-Business Park and the announcement of Colombia-based Alpina Foods LLC's decision to build its first U.S. manufacturing plant at the park underscores the strength of the region's food and beverage manufacturing sector, according to a release.
Additionally, Natcore Technology, Quintel Technology, Omni-ID and Intrinsiq Materials have entered the local market within the last year. Other companies including LiDestri Foods, Kraft Foods, General Motors, General Electric and M5 Networks have all announced plans for local expansion.
The rankings will be published in Business Facilities' July/August issue.

The world of competitive chili just got hotter with a partnership between the leader in chili cookoffs and festivals and the second largest food manufacturer in the world.
The International Chili Society (ICS) is joining forces with Kraft Foods to enrich and elevate competitive chili cookoffs. The partnership will allow both Kraft Foods and ICS to offer new and exciting ways for competitors and fans (called chiliheads) to participate in the cookoffs.
"We are excited to join forces with a company as renowned and respected as Kraft," said Carol Hancock, president of ICS. "Through this partnership, we will be able to offer more prize money for the teams and continue to grow our donations to the chili charity network. We'll also have the opportunity to engage and entertain more chili consumers and fans."
Through the new partnership, Kraft Foods will be introducing its line of Kraft Natural Cheese to both competitive chili cooks and chili consumers. While not a traditional ingredient in competition chili, cheese is a staple in most of the chili consumed by American families.
"The International Chili Society is a passionate organization," said Arthur Sevilla, Brand Manager at Kraft Foods. "We are looking forward to bringing natural cheese into Chili competitions delivering not only added flavor but also a smooth creamy melt to any chili dish."
Kraft Foods and ICS will begin rolling out new recipes, contests and consumer sampling and entertainment opportunities at chili cookoffs and festivals throughout the country, starting with the World's Championship Chili Cookoff in Manchester, N.H. Sept. 30-Oct. 1, 2011.
About ICS
Founded in 1967, the International Chili Society is an organization that sanctions chili cookoffs with judging and cooking rules & regulations. These events are worldwide and benefit charities or non-profit organizations. All winners of ICS sanctioned cookoffs qualify to compete for cash prizes and awards. Top-level winners compete for a total prize package of $55,000 at the World's Championship Chili Cookoff held each year in October. The ICS sanctions over 200 cookoffs annually with over one million people tasting, cooking, judging and having a great time. ICS sanctioned cookoffs include three categories: Red (traditional red chili), Chili Verde (green chili) and Salsa. The ICS annually crowns a World Champion in each category.

Justin's Nut Butter, based in Boulder, will feature Cheyenne Mountain Zoo's "Orangutan Friendly" logo on its products, which are sold in Safeway, King Soopers, Vitamin Cottage and Whole Foods stores in Colorado Springs.
The logo aims to draw awareness to the palm oil crisis and its direct relationship to the survival of the orangutans, said Dina Bredahl, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo animal care manager.
Palm oil is the most produced vegetable oil in the world and is used in products ranging from margarine and cosmetics to feedstock and for biofuel. As farmers cut away rainforests to plant the palms, orangutans are pushed out of their homes and are dying of starvation, she said.
But, boycotting palm oil products is not the solution, said Katie Borremans, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo spokeswoman. Last winter, the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo was the first zoo to join Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil, which has developed guidelines for palm oil production with minimal harm to the environment.
"Now Justin's, the Boulder-based all-natural nut butter company, is also a member of RSPO and the first company to adopt Cheyenne Mountain Zoo's 'Orangutan Friendly' logo on its packaging," she said. "It's very exciting for us because conservation is such a big part of what we do. This is our work in action. It helps us spread the conservation message."
Justin's, which sells its products across the country, is putting the zoo logo on its squeeze packs, which hit shelves this month. The logo makes it easier for consumers to identify products manufactured with sustainable palm oil.
"We don't believe boycotting palm oil - the harvesting and production of which is the livelihood of so many - is the solution; but rather it's being conscientious about where and how we source the ingredient," said Justin Gold, CEO and founder of Justin's. "For us the choice was easy: Justin's has always used sustainable organic palm oil supplied by CIRANDA and sourced from Brazil."
Cheyenne Mountain Zoo hopes more companies will become part of the RSPO. Some other companies, including Unilever PLC, Nestle SA and Kraft Foods Inc., have said they would seek to buy palm oil produced with minimal harm to the environment.
"By being the first company to use our logo, Justin's is helping us achieve our goal of moving the palm oil industry toward sustainability," Bredahl said. "It's a great feeling to know we are making a big difference."
Visitors to Cheyenne Mountain Zoo also can contribute to saving the orangutans through the zoo's "Quarters for Conservation" program. Visitors can choose from six conservation programs - save the orangutan, vultures, amphibians in Panama, leopards, penguins or snow leopards. For every person who buys a ticket to visit the zoo, 25 cents goes to conservation programs.
More than 500,000 people visit the zoo each year.
In fiscal year, 2010-2011, visitors contributed $12,521 to saving orangutans, Borremans said. Orangutans also are contributing to saving themselves through sales of their art. Each week, the orangutans paint on canvasses, which are sold at the zoo. Half the proceeds go to the conservation program, while half goes to the zoo's operation.
Zoo officials also have a shopping guide for visitors which details companies dedicated to the production of palm oil with minimal harm to the environment, and therefore to the homes of the orangutans.

Shareholders had their say, and all but a few of Chicago's top execs can rest easy about their pay.
At least until next year.
Only one Chicago firm, Navigant Consulting Inc., has failed to win approval in the first round of annual meetings since the Dodd-Frank Act's "say on pay" provision went into effect, giving shareholders an advisory vote on executive compensation.
Perhaps more telling, however, was another of the act's mandated, non-binding votes, which allowed shareholders at most companies to demand that say on pay be put on the agenda every year, rather than every two or three, guaranteeing it will be a perennial issue.
That means shareholder activists can keep up the pressure, targeting the handful of firms that failed to win pay-package approvals by at least 80%, compensation experts say, particularly the few that fell short of the 70% mark: Allstate Corp., CME Group Inc. and Northern Trust Corp.
"The fact that all of these companies are going to have to do it again next year, that's great," says Greg Kinczewski, general counsel at Marco Consulting Group Inc., a Chicago-based firm that advises activist-minded union and public pension funds on investment strategy and how to vote their shares. "This was just a trial run."
Of the 50 biggest publicly traded companies in Chicago, 28 received at least 90% approval of their compensation packages, slightly ahead of the 241 of the Fortune 500 clearing the bar at that level. Another 12 fell in the 80%-to-89% range, and five haven't held shareholder meetings since Jan. 21, when such votes were first required for companies with at least $75 million in publicly held shares.
That leaves five of the 50 biggest Chicago firms in the cross hairs of activist investors next year: the three that fell short of 70%, plus Abbott Laboratories and R. R. Donnelley & Sons Co., which fell in the 70%-to-79% range.
While the vote is merely advisory, anything less than 75% approval "is sort of an alert for companies to examine what the reason was behind the opposition," says Shirley Westcott, senior vice-president of Alliance Advisors LLC, a proxy solicitation and corporate governance consulting firm in Bloomfield, N.J. "It's a red flag for the board to talk to their top shareholders."
ADVISERS SPEAK UP
The biggest influence in the first year of say on pay has been the recommendations of proxy advisory firms. Allstate, CME and Northern Trust had pay packages opposed by Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., a prominent proxy adviser based in Rockville, Md. Donnelley, which received 71.2% approval, was supported by ISS but opposed by Glass Lewis & CO., a San Francisco proxy advisory firm.
The advisory firms split the opposite way on Northern Trust. In an email, a bank spokesman says: "In our view, the ISS recommendation was based in part on a comparison of Northern Trust to companies that are in entirely different and unrelated businesses," such as venture capital firms, pawn shops and payday lenders, rather than the largest U.S. banks, Northern's preferred yardstick.
None of the other companies responded to requests for comment.
"No" votes also correlate with sagging share prices. Donnelley, for instance, was the fourth-worst performer among major Chicago companies in 2010. Shares of Exelon Corp. and Baxter International Inc. trailed the overall equity market, too, but total pay for Exelon CEO John Rowe and Baxter CEO Robert Parkinson Jr. declined, earning shareholder approval in the mid-90% range.
"Most investors expect that CEO pay will remain flat or decline during a year of bad share performance," an ISS spokesman says. "Since that happened, most investors didn't have a problem with either company's pay practices."

Except at a few big local firms, shareholders strongly endorsed management's pay.

Efforts by major corporations to add diversity to their supply chains are allowing Sealaska Corp. to diversify its business model.
The latest collaboration for Sealaska is on retailer shelves now after the April 19 launch of the Brita Bottle, a 20-ounce squeezable bottle that allows filtered water to be enjoyed on the go. The product was launched on Earth Day to highlight its potential to reduce the immense amount of waste created by Americans throwing away some 38 billion water bottles per year.
Nypro Kanaak is a joint venture between Nypro Inc. and Sealaska, and is manufacturing the spout and lid and assembling the Brita Bottle at its Guadalajara facility for Brita's parent company, The Clorox Co. Nypro Kanaak also has facilities in Iowa and Alabama.
As the primary manufacturing subsidiary for Sealaska, Nypro Kanaak also does business with the likes of Procter and Gamble and Kraft Foods producing items like spouts for Tide detergent and highly complex injection molds and labels for Philadelphia cream cheese.
From 2007 to 2009, Sealaska earned between $2 million and $2.5 million per year in net income from its manufacturing business, according to annual reports. Gross revenues for manufacturing averaged about $68 million in 2007 and 2008 before softened demand in a weak global economy of 2009 saw gross revenue drop to $50.3 million.
Playing an integral rule in the launch of a major new product accompanied by a national advertising push is a sign Sealaska's manufacturing business has hit the big-time.
The launch of the Brita Bottle was a closely held secret, and Sealaska struggled to even get enough bottles to hand out to shareholders at its annual meeting in June with the product flying off the shelves.
"We're competing in a very challenging and difficult market, but we're able to go to our customers and show them that we can provide them with the best price, highest quality, diversity-supplied product they can buy." said Sealaska Executive Vice President Rick Harris.
Harris said many large corporations across the U.S. have developed diversity strategies with goals for doing business with minority-owned suppliers. Harris said Sealaska has gone to companies like Clorox and Procter and Gamble with the pitch that minority-owned businesses could do more for them than grounds keeping or building security.
"What we've tried to do is build relationships with some of America's large corporations, and to show them that minority-owned businesses can provide the goods and services they need," Harris said. "A lot of these companies have had diversity supply strategy, independent of us."
Just being a minority-owned business isn't all it takes, Harris said.
"All this does is get us in the door," Harris said. "You still have to do it best product possible at the lowest possible price. Then we're in a position to secure contracts. We also have to be innovative and prepared to work with them to create new product designs and ideas. With us and our partners, we're able to do that. We're able to work with them to create even better products."
