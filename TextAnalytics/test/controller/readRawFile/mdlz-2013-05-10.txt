Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES) ("Hess" or "the Company") today announced that, after consulting with its shareholders, it will separate the role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer immediately following its Annual Meeting to be held on Thursday, May 16 in Houston, TX. John Krenicki, former Vice Chairman of GE, has agreed to serve as Non-Executive Chairman, if he is elected together with the other Hess nominees.
John Krenicki said, "There is tremendous value in Hess, and management is executing on a clear and measurable plan that is already unlocking that value. Many shareholders with whom my fellow nominees and I have met over the past few months confirm and support this view. I speak for all of Hess' nominees in stating unequivocally our commitment to vigorously oversee the execution of the Hess plan on behalf of all shareholders, as well as the careful consideration, study and pursuit of all strategies to ensure continued value creation at Hess."
Krenicki added, "My fellow nominees have served as directors and as senior managers of leading global businesses. We strongly believe a board that is structurally divided by misaligned incentives such as Elliott's compensation scheme creates substantial risk. In an industry like oil and gas, where most successful projects produce returns over a longer time horizon, a subset of directors specifically incentivized to pursue short-term gains would introduce a troubling level of boardroom dysfunction. Rather than provide effective oversight, this structure could impede value creation by undermining a company's ability to attract and retain top talent as well as the confidence of current and potential partners who rely on a reliable and stable counterparty over the life of a project."
John Mullin, Hess' Lead Director, said, "As we continue our transformation to a pure play E&P company, we have heard from shareholders who approve of our strategy while also expressing a desire for better accountability, increased board oversight, and the adoption of best-in-class corporate governance practices. We understand our shareholders' views, and recognize that our corporate governance structure should have been improved sooner. Separating the roles of Chairman and CEO and declassifying our Board reflects our commitment to shareholders."
Mr. Mullin concluded, "John Krenicki has had a distinguished career as one of the top executives at GE where he ran GE Energy while overseeing GE's Oil & Gas, Power & Water, and Energy management businesses. Based on strong leadership qualities and unimpeachable independence, the Board believes that he - along with Hess' other director nominees - has the right blend of experience and sound judgment to provide accountability, while guiding Hess' transformation to a pure play E&P company for the benefit of all shareholders."
Following the annual meeting, the newly constituted Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will outline responsibilities for the Non-Executive Chairman that are consistent with corporate governance best practices. Further, Mr. Krenicki and the Board's new and continuing directors are committed to:
-- Providing independent oversight and holding management accountable for the successful execution of Hess' strategy;
-- Directing capital allocation decisions to strike the appropriate balance between funding growth and increasing shareholder returns;
-- When necessary, making changes to Hess' strategy to ensure the Company is driving shareholder value; and,
-- A Board renewal process under which the majority of the Board will be comprised of new directors by the end of 2013, in addition to the six new directors who will sit on the Hess Board following this election.
John B. Hess, Hess' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has stated his full support for the decision.
The annual meeting is less than one week away. Hess strongly recommends its shareholders to vote 'FOR' its world class slate of new, independent, unconflicted director nominees by promptly voting on the WHITE proxy card by telephone, by Internet, or by mail.

Wrigley pulls Alert caffeinated gum

Abstract: Casey Keller, Wrigley's North American president said in a statement that the Chicago-based gum giant has "paused production, sales and marketing of Alert," a caffeinated product launched just last month, in an effort to "give the FDA time to develop a new regulatory framework for the addition of caffeine to food and drinks.

Full text: May 09--Wrigley will pull a caffeinated gum on the heels of an investigation announcement by the Food and Drug Administration, the company said Wednesday.
Casey Keller, Wrigley's North American president said in a statement that the Chicago-based gum giant has "paused production, sales and marketing of Alert," a caffeinated product launched just last month, in an effort to "give the FDA time to develop a new regulatory framework for the addition of caffeine to food and drinks.
Last week, the FDA announced an investigation into what effect additional caffeine consumption may have on children.
"After discussions with the FDA, we have a greater appreciation for its concern about the proliferation of caffeine in the nation's food supply," Keller said. "There is a need for changes in the regulatory framework to better guide the consumers and the industry about the appropriate level and use of caffeinated products."
The world's largest gum manufacturer has underscored that Alert exceeds all guidelines for disclosure and that consumers wouldn't be buying the product by mistake. Alert was merchandised away from gum and candy, alongside products including 5-Hour Energy Shots.
Aimed at consumers age 25-49, Alert also carried a higher price tag, $2.99 for an 8-piece package, compared with $1.19 to $1.49 for a 15-piece pack of Extra, Orbit or 5.
Wrigley's foray into caffeinated gum was seen as an effort to broaden its core market. The gum segment has contracted in the United States since the recession, as teens, gum's most-loyal purchasers, spend their disposable income on other products.
The declines have been a particular headache for Deerfield-based Mondelez International, which said Tuesday that gum sales declined "in the high teens," during the most recent quarter. Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld said the company doesn't expect a turnaround this year. Mondelez makes Trident and other gums.

Full text: May 07--Mondelez International reported first quarter earnings rose 9 percent, to 34 cents per share, thanks in part to favorable tax rates.
Sales excluding the effect of currency and divestitures rose 3.8 percent, to $8.9 billion, for the quarter ended March 31.
"Our first quarter results were in line with the expectations we outlined earlier this year as we work through some near-term headwinds," Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld said in a statement. "Although we're not satisfied that our top-line growth remained below our long-term target, our results show that we've built solid underlying momentum."
Rosenfeld has a stated long-term goal of raising sales 5 to 7 percent, excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency. Lower coffee commodity prices hurt the company during the first quarter, impacting company sales by 1.3 percent.
The Deerfield-based package food giant was known as Kraft Foods until October, when it spun off its North American grocery business including brands Philadelphia, Kraft, Maxwell House and Planters.
Following a disclosure last month that activist investor Nelson Peltz had been buying up shares of PepsiCo and Mondelez, both companies have been the subject of merger rumors. Peltz is known for agitating with companies to spin-off or divest large chunks of its business to facilitate mergers.
Mondelez raised full-year earnings guidance three cents, to $1.55 to $1.60. The company will hold a call with investors at 4 p.m. CST.
Shares rose 1 percent to $31.41 in after-hours trading.

Rosenfeld brushes off talk of merger for Mondelez

Abstract: "There's no question that there's lots of chatter out there, and I'm not going to comment on the chatter," Rosenfeld said, alluding to rumors that investor Nelson Peltz has been amassing stock in Mondelez to merge it with the snack-foods business of PepsiCo Inc. "We have created a very unique company with tremendous opportunity for growth."

Full text: May 07--Mondelez International CEO Irene Rosenfeld sought to side-step speculation that her newly formed company may be on the brink of its third major event in as many years in a call with investors Tuesday.
"There's no question that there's lots of chatter out there, and I'm not going to comment on the chatter," Rosenfeld said, alluding to rumors that investor Nelson Peltz has been amassing stock in Mondelez to merge it with the snack-foods business of PepsiCo Inc. "We have created a very unique company with tremendous opportunity for growth."
She added that "consumer demand for snacking is growing at a very healthy rate around the world, especially in emerging markets," a primary factor in the decision to focus on that part of the business.
Mondelez, the Deerfield-based package food maker of Oreo, Triscuit and Tang, was known as Kraft Foods until October, when it spun off its North American grocery business including Philadelphia, Kraft, Maxwell House and Planters.
Last month, activist investor Peltz disclosed increased positions in Mondelez and PepsiCo, leading to speculation that he may be on the verge of pushing for a merger of the food and beverage giants. Peltz is widely seen as the architect of Kraft's Cadbury acquisition. As a significant Cadbury investor, he pushed for the spin-off of what's now known as Dr Pepper Snapple Group.
In early 2011, Rosenfeld acquired Cadbury, and products including Milka and Toblerone chocolates and gums such as Trident, Dentyne and Stride.
PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi has for years faced concerns about the long-term prospect of its bottled beverage business, as soda consumption is expected to decline. Pepsi's Frito-Lay division, whose stable includes Doritos, Tostitos and Lay's, however, has been a dependable growth driver.
Rosenfeld is a former CEO of Frito-Lay.
"While Mondelez is only beginning to exploit the potential opportunities that should result from operating as a focused global snacks business, the looming question is whether management would view a tie-up with PepsiCo favorably, as has been suggested," Morningstar analyst Erin Lash wrote in a research note.
She added that while her firm believes "any deal could unlock additional value for shareholders," it remains to be seen whether the two companies could reach a deal, credit markets would support "the nearly $46 billion of debt needed to consummate" it or whether regulators would approve it.
Peltz's Trian Fund Management did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Tuesday, Mondelez International reported first quarter earnings up 9 percent, to 34 cents per share, thanks in part to favorable tax rates.
Sales excluding the effect of currency and divestitures rose 3.8 percent to $8.9 billion for the quarter ended March 31.
Rosenfeld has a stated long-term goal of increasing sales 5 to 7 percent, without acquisitions, divestitures and currency. Lower coffee commodity prices hurt the company in the first quarter, reducing by 1.3 percent.
Sales in its gum business declined 1 percent overall and in the "high teens" in North America.
Its North American gum sales have been slipping since the recession, and the category has been contracting. Rosenfeld has often pointed to declining disposable income among teenagers, gum's most loyal users. Mondelez is the No. 2 gum maker, behind Wrigley.
Rosenfeld said the company is testing a number of ways to reverse these trends, including smaller packs at lower prices, larger packs providing value for the money and advertising that stresses the functional benefits of gum, such as oral health.
However, she said, "we're not counting on a significant turnaround in the gum business this year."
Mondelez raised full-year earnings guidance three cents, to $1.55 to $1.60.
Shares rose 1 percent to close at $31.41 following the late-afternoon release.

Publication info: PR Newswire [New York] 07 May 2013.

http://search.proquest.com/docview/1348922714?accountid=12492

Abstract: Adjusted Operating Income1 decreased 4.0 percent on a constant currency basis, and included a negative 3.4 percentage point impact from previously disclosed prior year one-time items.4 Excluding these items, gross profit gains were more than offset by higher SG&A predominately in emerging markets, including increased investments in sales capabilities, route-to-market expansion as well as advertising and consumer support. Adjusted Operating Income margin was 10.3 percent, down 1.6 percentage points, including the negative impacts of 0.6 percentage points due to the devaluation of net monetary assets in Venezuela and 0.4 percentage points from prior year one-time items.4 Diluted EPS was $0.32.

Full text: - Diluted EPS was $0.32; Operating EPS1 was $0.34, up 22.6% on a constant currency basis
- Company reaffirms 2013 Organic Net Revenue growth outlook at the low end of 5-7% range and raises Operating EPS guidance to $1.55-$1.60
DEERFIELD, Ill., May 7, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ: MDLZ) today reported first quarter 2013 results.
"Our first quarter results were in line with the expectations we outlined earlier this year as we work through some near-term headwinds," said Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and CEO. "Although we're not satisfied that our top-line growth remained below our long-term target, our results show that we've built solid underlying momentum. And I'm confident that we'll deliver our 2013 commitments as we continue to leverage our advantaged category mix, leading market positions and strong geographic footprint, particularly in emerging markets2."
Net revenues were $8.7 billion, up 0.9 percent. Organic Net Revenues increased 3.8 percent, including solid contributions from higher volume/mix of 2.5 percentage points and favorable pricing of 1.3 percentage points. The pass-through of lower coffee commodity costs tempered the company's overall top-line growth by 1.3 percentage points.
Revenues from emerging markets accelerated sequentially, up 9.3 percent, led by double-digit gains in China, Brazil and India, and continued improvement in Russia. Developed markets3 grew 0.4 percent, with growth in North America partially offset by the impact of lower coffee pricing in Europe and continued gum weakness.
Power Brands grew 7.5 percent, nearly double the company rate. Tuc/Club Social, Chips Ahoy!, Barni and Oreo biscuits, Milka, Cadbury Dairy Milk and Lacta chocolate, Halls candy, Stride gum and Tang beverages each posted strong increases.
Gross profit was $3.2 billion, up 1.5 percent, while gross profit margin was 37.1 percent. Adjusted Gross Profit1 increased 3.9 percent on a constant currency basis, driven by strong volume/mix gains. Pricing fully offset higher input costs. Adjusted Gross Profit margin was flat to prior year.
Operating income was $0.8 billion, down 7.6 percent, while operating income margin was 9.5 percent.
Adjusted Operating Income1 decreased 4.0 percent on a constant currency basis, and included a negative 3.4 percentage point impact from previously disclosed prior year one-time items.4 Excluding these items, gross profit gains were more than offset by higher SG&A predominately in emerging markets, including increased investments in sales capabilities, route-to-market expansion as well as advertising and consumer support.
Adjusted Operating Income margin was 10.3 percent, down 1.6 percentage points, including the negative impacts of 0.6 percentage points due to the devaluation of net monetary assets in Venezuela and 0.4 percentage points from prior year one-time items.4
Diluted EPS was $0.32. Operating EPS was $0.34, including a negative $0.04 impact from currency. On a constant currency basis, Operating EPS increased 22.6 percent, reflecting a positive $0.09 impact of lower taxes, primarily from discrete items.
Strong Momentum in Latin America Led by BrazilLatin America delivered strong top-line growth driven by a resurgence in Brazil and solid performance in other key markets in the region.
Net revenues increased 2.0 percent. Organic Net Revenues grew 12.6 percent, with contributions from both higher pricing and volume/mix. Brazil increased mid-teens with double-digit volume/mix gains and higher pricing.
Power Brands grew 12.3 percent, led by Club Social and Oreo biscuits, Lacta chocolate and Halls candy.
Segment operating income decreased 43.6 percent. Segment operating income margin decreased 5.3 percentage points to 6.6 percent.
Adjusted Segment Operating Income was flat versus prior year on a constant currency basis. Higher gross profit was offset by higher overheads, including increased investments in sales capabilities and route-to-market expansion. Adjusted Segment Operating Income margin was 6.9 percent, down 5.7 percentage points primarily due to negative impacts from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar.
Emerging Markets in Asia Pacific Drove Solid Top-line GrowthAsia Pacific delivered strong emerging markets performance despite capacity constraints in India, while the region's developed markets restrained overall growth.
Net revenues increased 3.6 percent. Organic Net Revenues grew 5.8 percent, driven by both higher volume/mix and pricing. Organic Net Revenues for the region's emerging markets grew double digits, led by China, India and the Philippines. Developed markets in the region declined low single digits, largely due to gum weakness in Japan.
Power Brands grew very strongly, up 20.3 percent, led by Oreo and Chips Ahoy! biscuits, Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate, Halls candy, Stride gum and Tang beverages.
Segment operating income increased 6.8 percent. Segment operating income margin increased 0.4 percentage points to 13.8 percent.
Adjusted Segment Operating Income increased 4.8 percent on a constant currency basis, including a positive 10.1 percentage point impact from cycling of a prior year asset impairment charge. Excluding this impact, higher gross profit was more than offset by higher overheads, including increased investments in sales capabilities and route-to-market expansion, as well as increased A&C support. Adjusted Segment Operating Income margin decreased 0.1 percentage point to 14.1 percent.
Strong Volume/Mix Growth for EEMEAStrong volume/mix gains across the region, as well as continued sequential improvement in Russia, drove solid top-line growth for the Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa region.
Net revenues increased 1.6 percent. Organic Net Revenues grew 4.0 percent, as strong volume/mix gains were partially offset by lower pricing. Russia continued to improve sequentially with organic growth in the low single digits behind strong volume/mix performance, partially offset by significantly lower pricing in coffee and chocolate.
Power Brands grew 8.1 percent, led by Oreo and Barni biscuits, Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate, Halls candy, and Jacobs and Tang beverages.
Segment operating income decreased 55.8 percent. Segment operating income margin decreased 9.2 percentage points to 7.1 percent.
Adjusted Segment Operating Income decreased 46.5 percent on a constant currency basis, including a negative 38.2 percentage point impact from cycling the prior year's gain on the sale of property in Russia. Excluding this impact, higher gross profit was more than offset by higher overheads, including increased investments in sales capabilities and route-to-market expansion, as well as increased A&C support.
Adjusted Segment Operating Income margin was 8.5 percent, down 8.9 percentage points, including a negative 6.7 percentage point impact from cycling the prior year's gain on the sale of property in Russia.
Steady Results in EuropeEurope delivered solid volume/mix gains in a difficult economic environment, while a significant headwind from coffee pricing tempered the top line overall.
Net revenues decreased 1.0 percent. Organic Net Revenues increased 0.1 percent, as volume/mix gains, particularly in chocolate and biscuits, were mostly offset by significant coffee pricing impacts. Lower coffee revenues negatively affected the region's growth by more than 2 percentage points.
Power Brands grew 2.8 percent, led by Oreo, belVita and chocobakery biscuits, Milka chocolate, Halls candy and Tassimo beverages.
Segment operating income decreased 4.7 percent. Segment operating income margin decreased 0.5 percentage points to 11.7 percent.
Adjusted Segment Operating Income was essentially flat to prior year on a constant currency basis. Adjusted Segment Operating Income margin held steady at 12.6 percent.
Solid Revenue Growth in North AmericaStrong biscuit performance in the U.S. and a return to growth in Canada drove a solid increase in Organic Net Revenue.
Net revenues increased 1.5 percent. Organic Net Revenues increased 2.4 percent, with contributions from both pricing and volume/mix. Biscuits in the U.S. grew mid-single digits for the seventh consecutive quarter. Canada performance improved with the resolution of its spin-related execution issues. Weak gum results, however, drove a high-single-digit decline in gum and candy, tempering the region's overall growth.
Power Brands grew 5.6 percent, led by biscuits, primarily Chips Ahoy! and Oreo.
Segment operating income increased 14.9 percent. Segment operating income margin increased 1.2 percentage points to 10.3 percent.
Adjusted Segment Operating Income was essentially flat to prior year on a constant currency basis. Adjusted Segment Operating Income margin was 11.6 percent, down 0.4 percentage points as lower gross margin, pressured by weak gum results, more than offset benefits from overhead leverage.
Outlook"Lower coffee pricing and capacity constraints in certain markets are expected to continue to temper top-line growth in the second quarter," said David Brearton, Executive Vice President and CFO. "However, we expect a strong rebound in the back half of the year, and we remain on track to deliver Organic Net Revenue growth at the low end of our long-term growth target of 5 to 7 percent. We're also raising our Operating EPS outlook to $1.55 to $1.605, as we flow through a portion of the benefit from discrete tax items."

End Notes
Please see discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this press release.
With the 2013 change in reporting structure, the company is introducing the emerging markets metric to illustrate performance where opportunities for growth exist due to favorable demographic trends, rising per capita incomes, improving infrastructures and other factors that have the potential to significantly drive GDP growth. Emerging markets, which accounted for nearly 40 percent of the company's revenues in 2012, consist of the Latin America and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa regions in their entirety; the Asia Pacific region, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and the following countries from the Europe region: Poland, Czech & Slovak Republics, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltics and the East Adriatic countries.
The company considers all markets not included in the emerging markets definition to be developed markets. Developed markets include the entire North America region, the Europe region, excluding the countries included in the emerging markets definition, and Australia, New Zealand and Japan from the Asia Pacific region.
Includes the prior year impacts of gain on sale of property in Russia and an asset impairment charge.
Operating EPS guidance of $1.55-$1.60 is based on 2012 average currency rates and includes the estimated impact of the write-down of the net monetary assets and the translation of operating income for the company's Venezuelan business stemming from that government's decision to devalue its currency to a fixed rate of 6.30/$US on February 8, 2013.
Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains a number of forward-looking statements. Words, and variations of words, such as "reaffirms," "expect," "on track," "deliver," "outlook," "guidance," "momentum" and similar expressions are intended to identify our forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about: 2013 guidance; delivering our 2013 commitments; leveraging our advantaged category mix, leading market positions and strong geographic footprint; and our Outlook, in particular, the impacts of lower coffee pricing and capacity constraints, a strong rebound in the back half of 2013, 2013 Organic Net Revenue growth and Operating EPS. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, continued volatility of commodity and other input costs, pricing actions, continued global economic weakness, risks from operating globally and tax law changes. Please also see our risk factors, as they may be amended from time to time, set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K. Mondelez International disclaims and does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement in this press release, except as required by applicable law or regulation.
Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We disclose non-GAAP financial measures so that you have the same financial data that we use to assist you in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing our underlying performance.
Our non-GAAP financial measures and corresponding metrics reflect how we evaluate our operating results currently and provide improved comparability of operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change over time:
"Organic Net Revenues" which is defined as net revenues excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures (including businesses under a sales agreement), Integration Program costs, accounting calendar changes and foreign currency rate fluctuations.
"Adjusted Gross Profit" which is defined as gross profit excluding the impact of pension costs related to obligations transferred in the Spin-Off, the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, the Integration Program and the operating results of divestitures (including businesses under a sales agreement). We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted Gross Profit on a constant currency basis.
"Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Segment Operating Income" which are defined as operating income (or segment operating income) excluding the impact of Spin-Off Costs, pension costs related to the obligations transferred in the Spin-Off, the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, the Integration Program, gains / losses from divestitures or acquisitions, acquisition-related costs and the operating results of divestitures (including businesses under a sales agreement). We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Segment Operating Income on a constant currency basis.
"Operating EPS" which is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondelez International from continuing operations excluding the impact of Spin-Off Costs, pension costs related to the obligations transferred in the Spin-Off, the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, the Integration Program, gains / losses from divestitures or acquisitions, acquisition-related costs and net earnings from divestitures (including businesses under a sales agreement), and including an interest expense adjustment related to the Spin-Off transaction. We also evaluate growth in our Operating EPS on a constant currency basis.
We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. In addition, the non-GAAP measures the company is using may differ from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Because GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis are neither accessible nor deemed to be significantly different from the non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort, with regard to the non-GAAP financial measures in the company's Outlook, the company has not provided that information.
See the attached schedules for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures referred to above to the most comparable GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012.
Segment Operating Income Management uses segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. The company believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), amortization of intangibles, gains and losses from divestitures and acquisitions, and acquisition-related costs (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) for all periods presented. The company excludes the unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results. Once realized, the gains and losses on hedging activities are recorded within segment operating results. We exclude general corporate expenses, amortization of intangibles, gains and losses on divestitures and acquisitions and acquisition-related costs from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results.

Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES) ("Hess" or "the Company") today released a white paper on the report issued by Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. ("ISS").
The Board recommends that shareholders vote FOR the election of Hess' highly qualified independent nominees on the WHITE proxy card.
For information about Hess' transformation and the 2013 Annual Meeting, please visit: www.transforminghess.com.
Included below is the full text of the white paper:
WHITE PAPER ON THE ISS REPORT ON HESS CORPORATION
Hess believes that the ISS report on the proxy contest with Elliott Management is a fundamentally flawed analysis that does not address key issues, including the fact that Hess has enhanced its governance by nominating five new, world-class independent director nominees to oversee and regularly review the continued execution of a market-endorsed transformation plan, and the highly problematic compensation scheme put in place for Elliott Management's dissident nominees. This White Paper seeks to provide shareholders with the information necessary to reach an independent judgment and make a wholly informed decision.
ISS' HESS RECOMMENDATION REFLECTS THE ORGANIZATION'S
INSTITUTIONAL BIAS TOWARD ACTIVIST SHAREHOLDERS
Institutional investors rely upon ISS or other proxy advisory firms to make objective, unbiased recommendations across a wide array of corporate voting matters. This responsibility is even more pronounced in contested situations in which companies face potentially value-threatening challenges. Given the importance of these situations, ISS owes a duty to its clients and to companies and their shareholders - a duty that mandates cogent, clear-eyed analysis of key issues.
Instead of objective analysis, however, recent history suggests that ISS has adopted a pervasive policy of bias in favor of the activist. According to a recent New York Times survey, ISS has backed the insurgent slate in 73% of the cases so far in 2013.
ISS' near-dogmatic presumption - that dissident directors are, by definition, beneficial if added to a corporate board - is undercutting their credibility. Increasingly, many investors are deciding of their own volition after careful study to support companies rather than following ISS' recommendation, as evidenced by outcomes in proxy contests at:
-- AOL / Starboard Value
-- Motorola / Carl Icahn
-- Target / Pershing Square
-- Barnes & Noble / Yucaipa
-- Oshkosh / Carl Icahn
-- Actelion / Elliott
-- Agrium / Jana
Unfortunately, in the Hess / Elliott case, ISS has continued to apply its philosophical preference for dissident nominees that is not supported by the facts.
ISS HAS DECIDED TO MANDATE ELLIOTT'S CHANGE
EVEN THOUGH HESS' CHANGES WILL DELIVER SUPERIOR VALUE
ISS claims that it focuses on two questions when analyzing proxy contests:
-- Have the dissidents made a compelling case that change is warranted?
-- If so, are the dissident nominees more likely to drive that change?
These questions, on their face, put the burden of proof on Elliott. In fact, ISS has shifted that burden to Hess. Nevertheless, Hess has more than met the burden and is successfully acting on a plan that is widely agreed to be economically superior to Elliott's breakup proposal, and which was well known and under way before Elliott's arrival on the scene, and is delivering shareholder value. Hess has also nominated a world-class slate of new, independent nominees to work with existing directors and oversee the execution of that plan. As independent research analysts have noted (additional commentary in Appendix B):
From here, we believe the value proposition comes to the fore while growing confidence in the growth outlook can secure recognition for a flagship Bakken asset we estimate is reasonably valued at ~$25 per share. Hess is our top pick.
-Doug Leggate, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, July 26, 2012
HES presented a robust, multi-pronged strategy to accelerate its pure-play E&P transformation... We view the company's proactive stance and exceptional clarity with its investor base as a major blow to activist claims.
-Eliot Javanmardi, Capital One, March 6, 2013
All-Star Board. HES will add six new independent directors, all former business executives, each with decades of distinguished careers, including three with extensive oil industry experience. The new board should help guide HES with executing its transformation strategy into a pure E&P play.
-Fadel Gheit, Oppenheimer, March 5, 2013
Although it is clear to almost everyone that Elliott has not offered a credible strategy, ISS seems to believe that Elliott's directors intend to pursue its breakup plan. As ISS' General Counsel Pat McGurn said on its May 3 "Special Bulletin" call:
"What [Elliott] really, really wants are a number of structural changes that they think are going to drive increased value. These are things like - one is splitting the company into an onshore vs. offshore."1
ISS goes further to agree that Elliott's directors intend to effect this rejected strategy, despite the fact that Elliott's nominees have either publicly disavowed the plan or admitted that they haven't ever read it:
"It is already clear that they share some of Elliott's views on what changes are necessary to unlock or create shareholder value at the firm--it is unlikely any candidate who disagreed with all the dissident's analysis would agree to stand in the first place."2
In short, ISS has recommended five nominees who were selected as part of an effort to force a flawed plan devised by a new activist shareholder, despite the fact that Hess is executing on a strategy that is delivering value: Hess recently reported first quarter results that soundly beat Wall Street estimates, Hess has reduced Bakken well costs while increasing productivity, and Hess has positioned itself to return capital directly to shareholders. Elliott's "change" is not the change that is in the best interests of shareholders.
ISS EMPLOYS TORTURED LOGIC TO CAST HESS NOMINEES AS BEHOLDEN TO
MANAGEMENT AND ELLIOTT NOMINEES AS "INDEPENDENT"
ISS absurdly states that Hess' director nominees "owe an allegiance to the incumbent CEO and directors for their nominations" simply on the basis that the Hess nominees came in through the nomination process. Each nominee was identified by Egon Zehnder, a leading independent director-recruitment firm, and went through the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee process, which is a requirement of the New York Stock Exchange. The Hess nominees also did considerable due diligence on the Company, the Hess plan, and the Elliott plan prior to agreeing to serve. By ISS' illogic, almost every independent director sitting on a corporate board today would therefore not be independent. Further, only in the world of ISS could director nominees' evaluation of a plan, which has been endorsed by a majority of shareholders and independent research analysts, be construed as a negative.
Our slate comprises some of the best business executives in the world with the right experience and expertise for Hess. ISS taints them as lacking independence without any evidence whatsoever. Biographies that detail their considerable accomplishments can be found in Appendix A and at www.transforminghess.com.
In contrast, ISS casts no aspersions on Elliott's nominees for having similar allegiance to Elliott on account of their nominations, and, in fact, rubber-stamps the independence of Elliott's nominees precisely because they were nominated by an activist hedge fund, even in spite of the compensation scheme paid by Elliott which far exceeds what they would receive from the Company as directors, if they were to be elected. ISS fails to address in any meaningful way the impact on independence and judgment of a novel short-term bonus scheme that leading independent corporate governance experts have called the "dark side" of activism:
In the new world of hedge fund activism, we need to look to whether individual directors are tied too closely by special compensation to those sponsoring and nominating them. Once we recognize that compensation can give rise to a conflict of interest that induces a director to subordinate his or her own judgment to that of the institution paying the director, our definition of independence needs to be updated.3
ISS' CONCLUSION RELIES ON THE FALSE PREMISE THAT ELLIOTT'S COMPENSATION
SCHEME IS ALIGNED WITH ALL SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS
ISS operates under the assumption that the dissident will not introduce a disruptive element to the board, despite the fact that each of Elliott's nominees has signed on to a special compensation scheme that could Balkanize the Board and create misaligned incentives. In this case, the issue of timing is critical. The Elliott compensation plan expires after a three-year period and Elliott's nominees have only three years to garner for themselves the cash payout. Although ISS threatens compensation committees with ouster if they do not strictly adhere to ISS' compensation schemes - without regard to the quality of the director or the company - ISS is willing to enthusiastically support directors who sign on to special short-term compensation packages paid directly by dissidents, the appropriateness and legality of which have been questioned by leading independent legal experts.
Despite the fact that ISS' view that $9 million "is probably not going to work as incentive" for men such as Harvey Golub because he's "far wealthier than that,"4 it is beyond belief that Elliott's nominees would not be financially motivated to take excessive risks by pursuing short-term, ultimately value-destructive actions rather than make deliberate judgments with the longer-term view for the benefit of all Hess shareholders.
Inasmuch as Elliott's nominees have only three years to guarantee a cash payout, they are motivated to pursue short-term goals in an industry that requires long-term patience. As any E&P professional will attest, it typically takes at least five to seven years to bring a project from exploration to first oil or first gas, and that process always carries with it a certain amount of execution risk. That risk is compounded by uncertainty, which creates a ripple effect through current and potential joint venture partners, employees, and ultimately negatively impacts shareholders. ISS, like Elliott, is not an oil & gas expert and does not appear to understand that destabilizing the boardroom by introducing a divisive element creates significant risk for shareholders at a time when Hess is executing well on its market-endorsed plan.
ISS FAILED TO ADDRESS FACTS REGARDING ELLIOTT NOMINEES
AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THEY COULD HAVE ON THE EXECUTION OF HESS' PLAN
Despite impugning the independence of Hess' nominees, ISS ignores the fact that Elliott has built a slate that is structurally incentivized to introduce a dangerous element of short-termism to a Board that is overseeing the execution of a market-endorsed transformation plan. ISS also appears to fail to take into account that Elliott's nominees have recent histories of board divisiveness, short-term thinking, conflicts of interest, and trackrecords of underperformance:
Regarding Harvey Golub: Mr. Golub's track record of divisiveness while on the board of AIG is well documented. He resigned as chairman of AIG after its CEO, Robert Benmosche, described their relationship as "ineffective and unsustainable."5
"The episode [to rescue AIG] exposed a growing rift between Benmosche and Golub, and Benmosche threatened to leave if the chairman remained. Golub resigned before the board members were forced to choose."6
Perhaps more relevant for Hess shareholders, however, is that after having been replaced as AIG chairman, he continued to urge a breakup of the company.
"Longer-term, AIG shouldn't exist [...] When it gets broken apart, as I think ultimately it will, both of those pieces may unlock much greater value."7
If Golub was successful in his effort to break up AIG, undermining Mr. Benmosche's strategy, AIG shareholders could have forfeited 305% returns that have been delivered under Mr. Benmosche's tenure.
Regarding Rodney Chase: ISS appears to have failed to do critical research on Chase, particularly with regard to evidence of sacrificing long-term value for short-term gain and his clear conflicts of interest.
In particular, Chase and the BP leadership team were significantly criticized for short-sighted and excessive cost-cutting efforts that jeopardized safety and performance. Many observers tie the destruction of shareholder value at BP to the safety decisions made by BP's senior leadership team.8 After the 2005 Texas City refinery explosion and fire, a report by the Chemical Safety Board (CSB) concluded:
"'Warning signs of a possible disaster were present for several years, but company officials did not intervene effectively to prevent it.' The CSB found 'a broken safety culture at BP' and that equipment maintenance was based on 'run to failure.'" 9
"BP targeted budget cuts of 25 percent in 1999 [during Chase's tenure] and another 25 percent in 2005, even though much of the refinery's infrastructure and process equipment were in disrepair."10
Chase's directorships at Genel and Tesoro also create significant conflicts if Chase were to become a director of Hess. Genel is a key competitor to Hess in Kurdistan and Tesoro is a significant purchaser of Hess Bakken crude.
Regarding Karl Kurz, David McManus, and Marshall Smith: Similarly, ISS does not appear to have considered facts about Elliott's other nominees that should give Hess shareholders pause. For example, Karl Kurz and David McManus have not delivered for shareholders since joining several boards:
-- Kurz - Global Geophysical Services is down 66%
-- McManus - Flex LNG is down 64%; Caza Oil and Gas is down 54%; Rockhopper Exploration is down 72%
And Smith, the CFO of Ultra Petroleum Corporation, has no public board experience and the stock of Ultra has declined 37% since he assumed the CFO position.
Based on these track records, the Elliott nominees do not deserve the benefit of ISS' unqualified recommendation.
ISS FAILED TO CONSIDER THE FACTS AND MISLED ITS CLIENTS
IN THEIR CONCLUSION ON HESS' BAKKEN COSTS
ISS' analysis ignores Hess' strong Bakken performance in Q1 2013--which Hess publicly announced over a week before ISS issued its report. Instead, ISS cites Elliott's stale data from 1H 2012. ISS ignores that Hess' drilling and completion costs per operated well averaged $8.6 million in Q1 2013. ISS blindly buys into Elliott's comparison of our Bakken well costs to a single, smaller, low cost peer without taking into account publicly available well recovery rates. From a capital return perspective, looking only at average well costs without factoring for production is an incomplete analysis. While Elliott's tactics would have ISS and investors believe otherwise, Hess' performance in the Bakken ranks among the best operators in terms of safety, cost, and productivity.
HESS IS CREATING THE RIGHT CHANGE FOR HESS SHAREHOLDERS
We recognize there are certain things that we should have done sooner. We frankly should have looked at refreshing our Board earlier, and we understand that we didn't move as soon as we should have. We will ensure that our outstanding plan and team has a corresponding superior governance and board framework to drive Hess' full value potential.
In this vein, the Board reiterates its unanimous recommendation that shareholders vote in favor of the Company's binding proposal to declassify the Hess Board of Directors, and the Hess Family shares will be voted in favor of the proposal. Further, in addition to adding six new directors this year, we remain committed to further renewal of our board and we will be consulting our shareholders in connection with an effort to refresh the majority of our Board.
We believe that by removing concerns over corporate governance, the market will be able to rate us solely according to the quality of our assets and the momentum in our business. Since Hess shifted its E&P strategy in 2010 from one of high-impact exploration to a more balanced approach of shale, exploitation, and focused exploration - well before Elliott came on the scene - Hess has executed a series of substantial steps to implement transformative change at the Company. We have nearly completed our announced sale of assets, have paid down short term debt and soon will be in a position to return capital directly to shareholders through a share repurchase program of up to $4 billion.
We recently delivered strong results with first quarter 2013 adjusted net income up 31% compared to the year ago quarter. These financial results were driven by our strong execution in the field - in the Bakken oil shale play, net production increased 55% while drilling and completion costs declined 36%. These results were driven by our E&P team, led by Greg Hill, Hess' President of Worldwide E&P, a pioneer of applying "lean manufacturing" technology to E&P.
We expect to continue to deliver value - our portfolio of higher growth, lower risk, oil linked E&P assets will deliver a five-year compound average annual production growth rate of 5 to 8%, based off of pro forma 2012 production, with aggregate mid-teens production growth between pro forma 2012 and 2014, while increasing returns to all shareholders.
Collectively, these actions have driven substantial outperformance of our peer index, with Hess shares up 20% in the period between our mid-year strategy update on July 25, 2012 and the January 28, 2013 announcement of our planned terminals sale, and 24% from January 28, 2013 to market close on May 3, 2013.
On the basis of the actions we have taken, as well as the value we are creating and the world-class candidates we have nominated, we do not believe that ISS (or Glass Lewis) has made its case for change at Hess. Increasing lasting shareholder value is what drives the Hess nominees. While they believe that the plan proposed by Hess and endorsed by the market is the right one for the current circumstances, and superior to the Elliott break-up plan, each is committed to the regular re-examination of the Hess plan and the careful study and pursuit of all strategies and options for building value for all shareholders.

He is widely acknowledged to be one of the world's top oil & gas executives, and will add invaluable insight to Hess' Board.
APPENDIX B: SELECT ANALYST COMMENTARY
With the steps taken over the past three years management has revealed a sound strategy that we believe is tough to beat... Hess is executing a strategy we believe underpins a material release of value.
--Doug Leggate, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, April 25, 2013
If the activist end game is an outright separation of Hess into two parts, we maintain our view that commensurate risks & challenges of two stand alone entities will blur the landscape for the investment case.
--Doug Leggate, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, April 25, 2013
With $3.4 Bn in announced proceeds, execution has been outstanding...
--Asit Sen, Cowen, April 3, 2013
Hess appears to be drilling one of the best portfolios of wells in the industry according to our analysis.
--Gil Yang, Discern, March 27, 2013
In short...we do not believe that [Elliott's] plan provides the best path forward. In our view, Hess's own plan makes more sense...
--Philip H. Weiss, Argus, March 27, 2013
We take management's side in terms of the future course of the company.... we do not think breaking up the company into an onshore resource player (Hess Resources) and international, mostly offshore, entity (Hess Remainco) is the best way to generate value.
--Jeb Armstrong, Credit Agricole, March 26, 2013
[The] Bakken wells that Hess was much punished for last year are a thing of the past.
--Jeb Armstrong, Credit Agricole, March 26, 2013
A potential Bakken spinoff would destroy future value and create tax and operational inefficiencies.
-- Fadel Gheit, Oppenheimer, March 13, 2013
More Value In The Whole. Our view is that given the tax leakage that would likely occur in the sale of the Bakken assets and the funding challenge that would occur for the international assets as a standalone operation negates much of the upside for a quick liquidation of the company.
-- Roger D. Read, Wells Fargo, March 12, 2013
HES presented a robust, multi-pronged strategy to accelerate its pure-play E&P transformation... We view the company's proactive stance and exceptional clarity with its investor base as a major blow to activist claims.
--Eliot Javanmardi, Capital One, March 6, 2013

"We hope that the organizations benefitting from these funds will be able to continue and expand the positive work they are doing in local communities," said Julie Gehrki, senior director of the Walmart Foundation. "We want to thank all those who participated in this campaign for their commitment to hunger relief, and we hope that the impact of the grant dollars we award will combine with new volunteers and greater public awareness of this issue to make a lasting impact in communities throughout the country."
With the help of ConAgra Foods, General Mills and Kellogg Company, Walmart was able to generate an additional 136,000 meals for Feeding America food banks through local market food drive events. Joining the General Mills event in Atlanta was country music artist Thomas Rhett, and in Nashville Emmy Award-winning analyst for ESPN's College GameDay, Kirk Herbstreit, partnered with Walmart and Kellogg.

As a part of this commitment, Walmart and its Foundation pledged to donate more than 1.1 billion pounds of food from Walmart stores, distribution centers and Sam's Club locations, valued at $1.75 billion, as well as $250 million in grants to support hunger relief organizations.

Abstract: The company posted gains in its beverage business, up 28 percent to $125 million, with growth in Kool-Aid and Mio tempering the effect of green coffee prices on Maxwell House, and its cheese business, up 3 percent to $172 million, as consumption of natural cheese and Velveeta grew.

Full text: May 02--Kraft Foods Group topped expectations for first quarter earnings Thursday, despite costs related to its spin-off.
For the quarter ended March 31, the company posted earnings of $456 million, or 76 cents per share, down from $483 million. Analysts had been expecting 64 cents, according to Bloomberg.
Net revenue rose 2 percent, to $4.55 billion, thanks in part to an early Easter, and despite selling off some products. Analysts were expecting $4.48 billion.
Northfield-based Kraft, the maker of Oscar Mayer, Maxwell House and Planters, was spun off from Mondelez International, the maker of Oreo, Ritz and Trident, in October. In the first quarter, Kraft incurred $119 million in restructuring costs and $123 million in interest expense related to that.
"We're off to a solid start," Kraft CEO Tony Vernon said in a statement. "Our first quarter results reflect strong returns on our new product innovations to date, as well as the fact that our cost savings outpaced our plans to reinvest in our brands."
Kraft reiterated full-year earnings guidance of about $2.75 per share.
By division, Kraft's biggest business, grocery, with products including Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, declined 3 percent to $328 million, due to weakness in Jell-O, Planters and Kraft dressings.
The company posted gains in its beverage business, up 28 percent to $125 million, with growth in Kool-Aid and Mio tempering the effect of green coffee prices on Maxwell House, and its cheese business, up 3 percent to $172 million, as consumption of natural cheese and Velveeta grew. The company's refrigerated meals business rose 4 percent to $97 million, thanks to higher prices and Lunchables.

KRAFT FOODS GROUP REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2013 RESULTS

Publication info: PR Newswire [New York] 02 May 2013.

http://search.proquest.com/docview/1347628687?accountid=12492

Abstract: First quarter results also included $0.12 per share of Restructuring Program charges. Strong operating income growth was led by improved volume/mix, lower manufacturing costs driven by net productivity gains and overhead cost savings, partly offset by higher Restructuring Program costs and the negative impact of pricing net of commodity costs.

Full text: - Cost management and favorable volume/mix drove Q1 EPS of $0.76
- Focus on cash resulted in improved Free Cash Flow(2) performance
- Company on track to deliver EPS of approximately $2.75 in 2013
NORTHFIELD, Ill., May 2, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: KRFT) today reported solid first quarter 2013 results driven by significant productivity gains and overhead cost savings as well as topline growth fueled by new products and increased investments in marketing.
(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090420/KRAFTLOGO)
"We're off to a solid start," said Tony Vernon, CEO of Kraft. "Our first quarter results reflect strong returns on our new product innovations to date, as well as the fact that our cost savings outpaced our plans to reinvest in our brands. In the months to come, we'll execute our marketing playbook more broadly across our portfolio and we expect to see good progress in both top- and bottom-line performance for the full year."
Q1 FINANCIAL SUMMARY
Net revenues in the first quarter grew 2.1 percent to $4.5 billion.
Organic Net Revenues increased 2.1 percent from volume/mix gains of 2.4 percentage points that were partly offset by a 0.3 percentage point impact from lower pricing.
The timing of Easter shipments added between 0.5 and 1.0 percentage points of net revenue growth versus the prior year quarter while product line pruning negatively impacted first quarter growth by approximately 0.7 percentage points.
Operating income in the first quarter increased 9.2 percent to $809 million.
Results reflected gains from productivity, overhead cost savings, improved product mix and volume growth.
Restructuring Program(3) costs increased $64 million to $119 million in the first quarter and negatively impacted operating income growth by 7.4 percentage points.
Earnings per share in the first quarter were $0.76.
Earnings reflected strong gains from operations and puts the company on pace to deliver its full year earnings guidance.
Interest expense in the quarter was $123 million or approximately $0.13 per share, reflecting the company's capital structure as an independent company.
First quarter results also included $0.12 per share of Restructuring Program charges.
Free Cash Flow in the first quarter was $147 million.
Strong operating performance and improved working capital management led to positive Free Cash Flow for the first quarter; a quarter that typically results in a use of cash.
HIGHLIGHTS BY REPORTING SEGMENT
Beverages:
The Kool-Aid and Capri Sun franchises delivered strong volume/mix in the quarter. Top-line growth was tempered, however, by lower pricing in coffee as green coffee costs declined.
Strong operating income growth was led by improved volume/mix, lower manufacturing costs driven by net productivity gains and overhead cost savings, partly offset by higher Restructuring Program costs and the negative impact of pricing net of commodity costs.
Cheese:
Strong volume and improved product mix were driven by significant consumption growth in Kraft natural cheeses and Velveeta.
Operating income growth reflected solid volume/mix, overhead cost savings and lower manufacturing costs driven by net productivity that were partly offset by the negative impact of pricing net of commodity costs and higher Restructuring Program costs.
Refrigerated Meals:
Revenue growth reflected the benefits of pricing to offset higher commodity costs, ongoing gains from Lunchables innovation and higher year-over-year bacon sales from the timing of Easter. However, product line pruning tempered growth in the quarter.
Operating income growth reflected overhead cost savings and the positive impact of pricing net of commodity costs that more than offset higher Restructuring Program costs and investments in marketing.
Grocery:
Top-line gains from investments in innovation behind brands such as Velveeta dinners and Kraft Macaroni & Cheese were offset by weakness in JELL-O ready-to-eat desserts, Kraft dressings and Planters snack nuts.
Operating income declined as a combination of marketing investments, lower volumes and higher Restructuring Program costs more than offset significant overhead cost savings.
International & Foodservice:
Strong revenue growth in Canada from Cracker Barrel cheese, Philadelphia cream cheese and MiO liquid water enhancers was partially offset by product line pruning in Foodservice.
Double-digit operating income growth was driven by improved product mix, and lower overhead costs, partly offset by a significant increase in marketing.
OUTLOOK
"Our cash generation in the first quarter was very encouraging and, overall, we're on track to deliver every element of our 2013 financial guidance," said Tim McLevish, CFO of Kraft.
Kraft reaffirmed its guidance for 2013, including:
Organic Net Revenue growth in line with growth of the North American food and beverage market;
EPS of approximately $2.75; and
Free Cash Flow of approximately $1 billion.(4)

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains a number of forward-looking statements. The words "deliver," "continue," "believe," "can," "will," "expect" and similar expressions are intended to identify the forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding Kraft's growth, progress, Organic Net Revenue growth, EPS and Free Cash Flow. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Kraft's control. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, increased competition; continued consumer weakness and weakness in economic conditions; Kraft's ability to differentiate its products from retailer and economy brands; Kraft's ability to maintain its reputation and brand image; continued volatility and increases in commodity and other input costs; pricing actions; increased costs of sales; regulatory or legal changes, restrictions or actions; unanticipated expenses and business disruptions; product recalls and product liability claims; unexpected safety or manufacturing issues; Kraft's indebtedness and its ability to pay its indebtedness; Kraft's inability to protect its intellectual property rights; tax law changes; Kraft's ability to achieve the benefits it expects to achieve from the spin-off and to do so in a timely and cost-effective manner; and its lack of operating history as an independent, publicly traded company. For additional information on these and other factors that could affect Kraft's forward-looking statements, see Kraft's risk factors, as they may be amended from time to time, set forth in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2012. Kraft disclaims and does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement in this press release, except as required by applicable law or regulation.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Kraft reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP").
Kraft's top-line measure is Organic Net Revenues, which is defined as net revenues excluding the impact of transactions with Mondelez International, Inc., acquisitions, divestitures (including the termination of a full line of business due to the loss of a licensing or distribution arrangement, and the complete exit of business out of a foreign country), currency and the 53rd week of shipments in 2011. Organic Net Revenues is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes better reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of Kraft's business and provides improved comparability of results.
See the attached schedules for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures referred to above to the most comparable GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 30, 2013 and March 31, 2012. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, Kraft's results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP measures Kraft uses may differ from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, and other companies may not define the non-GAAP measures Kraft uses in the same way.
(1)Organic Net Revenue is a Non-GAAP Financial Measure. Please see discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and reconciliation to GAAP at the end of this press release.
(2)Free Cash Flow is a Non-GAAP Financial Measure and is defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Please see the reconciliation to GAAP at the end of this press release.
(3)As previously disclosed, on Oct. 29, 2012, Kraft Foods Group's Board of Directors approved a $650 million restructuring, related implementation and spin-off transition program ("Restructuring Program") reflecting primarily severance, asset disposals, other manufacturing-related one-time costs and professional service fees within its finance, legal and information systems functions.
(4)Free Cash Flow = Cash Flow from Operations (~$1.7 billion) less Capital Expenditures (~$0.7 billion).

Full text: CHICAGO, April 30, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Zacks Equity Research highlights Graco Inc. (NYSE:GGG) as the Bull of the Day and Maidenform Brands Inc. (NYSE:MFB) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Kraft Foods Group (Nasdaq:KRFT), Mondelez International (Nasdaq:MDLZ) and Flower Foods Inc. (NYSE:FLO).
(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20101027/ZIRLOGO)
Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678.
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
Bull of the Day:
The industrial companies are hanging in there despite predictions that the end of the cycle is near. Graco Inc. (NYSE:GGG) recently beat the Zacks Consensus by 15.1%. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to grow earnings in the double digits in both 2013 and in 2014.
Graco may not be a household name, but it makes products which influence everyday life. It makes fluid-handling equipment and systems, with one of its best known products being the spray gun which is used to apply paint to homes, businesses and cars. But its systems also have other applications including squeezing tomato paste onto millions of frozen pizzas.
Founded in 1926 in Minnesota, the company has survived many different recessions and economic conditions. It is now global, with a diverse worldwide customer base.
On Apr 24, Graco announced record sales as they jumped 15% compared to a year ago to $269 million, however some of that was driven by the acquisition of Gema powder finishing business in August of 2012.
Bear of the Day:
Estimates are sinking on Maidenform Brands Inc. (NYSE:MFB) ahead of its first quarter earnings report on May 8 after it warned in March that 2013 would be a "transitional" year. This intimate apparel maker is now a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
Maidenform Brands makes intimate apparel products, including bras, panties and shapewear, under many well known brands including Maidenform, Control It!, Lilyette, Self Expressions and Sweet Nothings, among others.
Maidenform has been riding the hot trend in shapewear for years but reliance on that one hot product finally caught up with the company in 2012 as it saw increased competition in the shapewear category from both department and chain stores. The secret is out and there little no barrier to entry for competitors.
In March, the company reported that full year fiscal 2012 sales declined 1% to $600.3 million. The outlook for 2013 doesn't look that much better. The company isn't expecting a turnaround until 2014.
Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog:
Will Kraft Foods Beat Earnings?
Kraft Foods Group (Nasdaq:KRFT) is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2013 results on May 2 after the market closes. Last quarter, it posted a 90% positive surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.
Kraft Foods Group was spun off from Kraft Foods, Inc into an independent company last year in October. Kraft Foods Group includes the North American grocery business of the old Kraft Foods which has been renamed to Mondelez International (Nasdaq:MDLZ), but now comprises only its global snacks business.
Factors to Consider This Quarter
The top line was quite weak in the fourth quarter due to the difficult year-ago comparisons and volume declines (due to retailer inventory shifts and more product pruning). Kraft Foods was not much successful in raising prices either.
Management is not too bullish for the first quarter of 2013 as well given the difficult year-ago comparison which included some price increases that are not expected to be repeated in this quarter. Moreover, management does not expect a full recovery from the consumption declines seen in the fourth quarter of 2012.
However, like the fourth quarter of 2012, the first quarter's profits could see tailwinds from strong productivity gains and cost savings which can partially offset headwinds from the sluggish top line.
Earnings Whispers?
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Kraft Foods is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP (Read: Zacks Earnings ESP: A Better Method) and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.
Zacks ESP: The Zacks ESP is 0.0%.
Zacks Rank #2 (Buy): Kraft Foods carries a Zacks Rank#2 (Buy). However the Zacks #2 Rank when combined with a 0.0% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against stocks with Zacks #4 and #5 Ranks (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement.
Other Stocks to Consider
Here are some other food companies you may want to consider, as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:
Flower Foods Inc. (NYSE:FLO), with Earnings ESP of +14.63% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
